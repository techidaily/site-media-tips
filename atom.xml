    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Upcoming-Price-Hike-What-You-Need-to-Know-About-the-New-Netflix-Rates"><a href="#Upcoming-Price-Hike-What-You-Need-to-Know-About-the-New-Netflix-Rates" class="headerlink" title="Upcoming Price Hike: What You Need to Know About the New Netflix Rates"></a>Upcoming Price Hike: What You Need to Know About the New Netflix Rates</h2><p>Many streaming services have increased prices over the past few months, like <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-strategizing-your-approach-highlight-and-story-downloads/" >Disney+ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/8-safe-and-effective-methods-to-unlock-your-apple-iphone-14-pro-without-a-passcode-by-drfone-ios/" >Paramount+ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and some of them have done it multiple times over the past two years. Netflix has been slowly increasing prices, and it also <a class="link"   href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/building-bonds-youtube-and-brands-in-unity/" >stopped offering its cheapest ad-free plan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to new subscribers in the US and other countries. Now, Netflix’s prices are going up once again.</p><p> Netflix announced a new round of pricing changes in its Q3 2023 financial results this week. Really, the only thing that’s changing here right now is the fact that the Premium tier, which was previously $19.99, is going up to $22.99. All other tiers, however, remain the same price: Standard is $15.49, while Standard with ads is $6.99. In addition, adding an extra user to share your account with is going to be an extra $7.99 on top of your subscription, regardless of what tier you have.</p><p> In addition, if you happen to have the Basic tier (which you can’t sign up for anymore, but existing subscribers can still keep it), you will see your monthly subscription go up to $11.99. So even if you’re grandfathered from a plan that’s not available anymore, you’ll still have to pay more. The Basic plan was removed back in July, and while it doesn’t look like it’ll be taken away from users who already pay for it (at least for now), Netflix also doesn’t look like it wants to reintroduce it anytime soon, has this to say about it in its latest earnings call:</p><blockquote><p>This growth has been driven by improvements to our offering — including two streams, higher quality video and a programming slate that’s now essentially on par with our other plans — as well as the phasing out of our Basic plan for new and rejoining members in the US, the UK, Italy and Canada.</p></blockquote><p> The good part is that if you’re paying for Standard, you won’t see a price hike for now, so you can just keep on binging your shows and movies as you’ve always done. Netflix might decide to increase these lower plans in the future, though.</p><p> Source: <a class="link"   href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc%5Ffinancials/2023/q3/FINAL-Q3-23-Shareholder-Letter.pdf" >Netflix <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/18/23922319/netflix-q3-earnings-2023-price-hike-increase-basic-premium" >The Verge <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-create-endless-video-on-iphone/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved How-To Create Endless Video on iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-microscopic-views-on-ms-teams-chat/"><u>[Updated] Mastering Microscopic Views on MS Teams Chat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-accelerate-thumbnail-designs-for-professional-valorant-portraits/"><u>2024 Approved Accelerate Thumbnail Designs for Professional Valorant Portraits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/honored-advisors-elite-iphone-audio-experts/"><u>Honored Advisors Elite iPhone Audio Experts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-make-a-movie-in-minutes-a-quickstart-guide/"><u>New In 2024, Make a Movie in Minutes A Quickstart Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/resolving-connection-errors-a-players-guide-to-restoring-lost-connectivity-in-escape-from-tarkov/"><u>Resolving Connection Errors: A Player’s Guide to Restoring Lost Connectivity in Escape From Tarkov</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/the-vida-journey-from-raw-footage-to-cinematic-scene-for-2024/"><u>The Vida Journey From Raw Footage to Cinematic Scene for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/tired-of-unwanted-youtube-content-discover-the-secrets-to-improving-your-personalized-video-recommendations/"><u>Tired of Unwanted YouTube Content?

    <title>Increased Advertising on YouTube: What You Need To Know</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Increased-Advertising-on-YouTube-What-You-Need-To-Know"><a href="#Increased-Advertising-on-YouTube-What-You-Need-To-Know" class="headerlink" title="Increased Advertising on YouTube: What You Need To Know"></a>Increased Advertising on YouTube: What You Need To Know</h2><p>YouTube <em>really</em> likes advertisements at this point. If you’re not a YouTube Premium subscriber, you need to deal with multiple ads in a row, longer ads, and more frequent ad interruptions. Unfortunately, Google is now experimenting with yet another ad format in YouTube.</p><p> Google has hinted that it might roll out something called “pause ads” more widely to <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/swift-switcheroo-rearranging-yt-lists-in-a-minute/" >users on TVs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after an initial test of the format was hugely successful. What’s a pause ad, exactly? Well, it’s an ad that shows up when you pause a video. When you hit pause mid-stream, the video you’re watching will shrink, and an ad will appear right next to it. The ads can be seen as a little less “invasive” than most other ads on the platform, as it can be easily dismissed and the ad itself is just a banner with no movement or sound. If you’ve seen that kind of ad before, you were part of Google’s initial test, but there’s a real chance that it’ll now roll out to everyone.</p><p> Google’s Philipp Schindler said that “in Q1, we saw strong traction from the introduction of a pause ads pilot on connected TVs, a new non-interruptive ad format that appears when users pause their organic content.” He’s not saying they will roll out more widely, but if an ad format is this successful, then it means it will appear on your TV eventually too.</p><p> While this is probably one of the less invasive types of ads in YouTube (which might be why it’s seeing a lot of success), it’s hard to not be annoyed when you see how ad-filled YouTube is right now. Sure, a banner when you pause a video might not grind your gears, but when you see it after watching two ads at the beginning of the video and probably another two mid-video, it does feel a bit like things are getting out of hand. Then again, with competing streaming services like Netflix realizing that <a class="link"   href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/netflixs-ad-tier-23-million-monthly-users-1235868024/" >most people will put up with ads <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Google probably knows this won’t tip the balance for most viewers.</p><p> Source: <a class="link"   href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-tv-ads-3326320/" >Android Authority <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-social-media-strategies-mastering-igs-most-trending-hashtags/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Social Media Strategies Mastering IG's Most Trending Hashtags</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-quick-start-uploading-your-videos-to-instagram-via-pcmac/"><u>[New] In 2024, Quick Start Uploading Your Videos to Instagram via PC/Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-reel-in-viewers-mastery-of-live-360-video-broadcasts-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Reel In Viewers Mastery of Live 360 Video Broadcasts on Youtube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-innovative-strategies-for-captivate-demonstrations/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Innovative Strategies for Captivate Demonstrations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-prime-zero-dollar-webcam-recorder-app/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Prime Zero-Dollar Webcam Recorder App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/54sh5paz44ki44ox44oq44gn57ch5y2y44gr5yuv55s744gu44kr44od44oi57eo6zug44gm5yplusv6io977yb/"><u>無料アプリで簡単に動画のカット編集が可能！</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/disney-series-set-to-arrive-on-netflix-in-the-coming-year/"><u>Disney Series Set to Arrive on Netflix in the Coming Year</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/elevate-your-cinema-the-ultimate-selection-of-10-masterpieces-for-oled-tv-owners/"><u>Elevate Your Cinema: The Ultimate Selection of 10 Masterpieces for OLED TV Owners</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/elevate-your-viewing-max-invites-you-to-upgrade-to-ultra-hd-4k-content-at-a-special-price/"><u>Elevate Your Viewing: Max Invites You to Upgrade to Ultra HD 4K Content at a Special Price!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/embrace-comfort-secure-your-beloved-tv-series-on-blu-ray/"><u>Embrace Comfort: Secure Your Beloved TV Series on Blu-Ray</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/enhance-watch-time-by-controlling-plex-video-speed-settings-easily/"><u>Enhance Watch Time by Controlling Plex Video Speed Settings Easily!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/evolution-in-kodi-platform-shifting-towards-flatpak-approach-for-enhanced-linux-setup-experience/"><u>Evolution in Kodi Platform: Shifting Towards Flatpak Approach for Enhanced Linux Setup Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/exclusive-offer-save-20-on-plex-lifetime-membership-today/"><u>Exclusive Offer: Save 20% on Plex Lifetime Membership Today!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/full-guide-to-fix-itoolab-anygo-not-working-on-oppo-reno-9a-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Full Guide to Fix iToolab AnyGO Not Working On Oppo Reno 9A | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-list-of-reliable-myvidster-video-extractors-tips-and-tricks-for-easy-downloads/"><u>The Ultimate List of Reliable MyVidster Video Extractors: Tips and Tricks for Easy Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-exclusive.techidaily.com/top-10-video-editing-software-choices-for-your-pc/"><u>Top 10 Video Editing Software Choices for Your PC</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134234/18498" target="_top" id="2134234">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134234" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134234/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

    <title>Revamped Plex Poster Collection: A Fresh Look at Your Favorite Films</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Revamped-Plex-Poster-Collection-A-Fresh-Look-at-Your-Favorite-Films"><a href="#Revamped-Plex-Poster-Collection-A-Fresh-Look-at-Your-Favorite-Films" class="headerlink" title="Revamped Plex Poster Collection: A Fresh Look at Your Favorite Films"></a>Revamped Plex Poster Collection: A Fresh Look at Your Favorite Films</h2><p>Plex has changed its primary metadata source for movie posters. As a result, you should encounter higher-quality artwork within your personal library and the Plex service as a whole. Posters that you have manually selected or uploaded will not be affected by this change.</p><p> It’s been three years since the introduction of the <a class="link"   href="https://forums.plex.tv/t/introducing-the-new-plex-movie-agent/615989" >Plex Movie agent <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which retrieves movie posters from TMDB, Fanart.tv, and CineMaterial. But the platform has adopted a new “primary metadata source” to improve the quality of movie artwork, especially for niche titles. Presumably, the word “primary” means that TMDB and other sources will be treated as a fallback—Plex may still pull artwork from secondary sources when needed, though this hasn’t been confirmed.</p><p> Plex says that its new metadata source will improve the quality of movie posters. In most cases, this change will be “imperceptible.” But it should have a huge impact on lesser-known movies, which tend to have low-quality posters, incorrectly-sized posters, foreign posters, or no artwork at all. Additionally, this upgrade will help Plex manage its metadata database, but Plex hasn’t clarified why it will have this effect.</p><p> The name of this new metadata source is also a mystery. Plex has bolstered its <a class="link"   href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-netflix-location-to-get-more-country-version-on-realme-narzo-60-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >FAST <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-from-apple-iphone-13-to-samsung-galaxy-s20-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/" >AVOD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offerings in recent years, and it’s preparing to launch a <a class="link"   href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/possible-solutions-to-restore-deleted-call-logs-from-motorola-by-fonelab-android-recover-call-logs/" >video rental service <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, so the new source may be some industry player that works with other streaming services. Again, we don’t know.</p><p> Note that Plex will still allow movie poster customization, and it will continue to provide alternate posters for the content in your media library. Any movie posters that you have manually selected will not be altered, but movies that use the default artwork will be updated. The new metadata source will also serve movie artwork for Plex Discover and the Plex ad-supported video library.</p><p> It may take a few days for the new metadata source to complete its rollout. You should notice an immediate change within the greater Plex service, but movie posters in your personal library won’t update until your next metadata refresh, which occurs every three days under Plex’s default settings. If you don’t use the default Plex Movie agent, you won’t see any changes.</p><p> Source: <a class="link"   href="https://forums.plex.tv/t/movie-artwork-updates/867738" >Plex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-eyedome-recorder-chromeos-screen-snapshots/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved EyeDome Recorder ChromeOS Screen Snapshots</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-comedy-in-a-click-best-funny-short-video-suggestions-for-youtubers/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Comedy in a Click Best Funny Short Video Suggestions for YouTubers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/access-recovery-mastering-post-hack-facebook-fixes-for-2024/"><u>Access Recovery Mastering Post-Hack Facebook Fixes for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/how-to-maximize-focus-with-enhanced-zoom-on-google-meet-for-2024/"><u>How to Maximize Focus with Enhanced Zoom on Google Meet for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlink-your-apple-iphone-11-pro-from-your-apple-id-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Unlink Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro From Your Apple ID</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-turning-chaos-into-clarity-in-your-burdened-tiktok-archive/"><u>In 2024, Turning Chaos Into Clarity in Your Burdened TikTok Archive</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/navigating-the-world-of-gpt-3-five-strategies-for-leveraging-chatgpt-without-registration/"><u>Navigating the World of GPT-3: Five Strategies for Leveraging ChatGPT Without Registration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/step-by-step-strategies-for-structuring-emails-with-gmails-label-feature/"><u>Step-by-Step Strategies for Structuring Emails with Gmail's Label Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/the-lasting-appeal-of-internet-broadcasts-amidst-modern-streaming-services/"><u>The Lasting Appeal of Internet Broadcasts Amidst Modern Streaming Services</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/the-must-check-list-for-every-collector-evaluating-secondhand-dvds-and-blu-ray-movies/"><u>The Must-Check List for Every Collector: Evaluating Secondhand DVDs & Blu-Ray Movies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/transforming-playlists-into-connections-spotifys-evolution-into-a-social-hub/"><u>Transforming Playlists Into Connections: Spotify's Evolution Into a Social Hub</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130891/7443" target="_top" id="2130891">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130891" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130891/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Critical-Alert-More-Than-15-000-Roku-Logins-Compromised-Through-Weak-Password-Habits"><a href="#Critical-Alert-More-Than-15-000-Roku-Logins-Compromised-Through-Weak-Password-Habits" class="headerlink" title="Critical Alert: More Than 15,000 Roku Logins Compromised Through Weak Password Habits"></a>Critical Alert: More Than 15,000 Roku Logins Compromised Through Weak Password Habits</h2><p>In a new <a class="link"   href="http://oag.ca.gov/system/files/Template%20Notification%203-8-2024.pdf" >breach notice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Roku says that hackers hijacked over 15,000 user accounts and utilized customers’ saved credit card information. However, Roku’s security was not compromised in this breach. This is a case of customers reusing old passwords.</p><p> An attack method called <a class="link"   href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/how-to-shoot-vertical-panorama-photos-with-your-smartphone-androidios-for-2024/" >credential stuffing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is responsible for this breach. Credential stuffing is incredibly simple—hackers take a list of known email and password combinations, dump each one into a website’s login field, and take note of any credentials that produce a successful login. The emails and passwords used in this breach were obtained from previous, unrelated data breaches.</p><p> Several individuals or groups may have participated in this attack. They likely used credential-stuffing tools like Open Bullet 2 to automate the attack process. And, as discovered by <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-15-000-hacked-roku-accounts-sold-for-50-each-to-buy-hardware/"><em>Bleeping Computer</em></a>, compromised Roku accounts were sold on Telegram and other platforms for as little as 50¢ apiece. Buyers were encouraged to immediately change the login and recovery details for purchased accounts. In some cases, these buyers also used customers’ credit card information to purchase new streaming subscriptions or Roku hardware.</p><blockquote><p>“Through our investigation, we determined that unauthorized actors had likely obtained certain usernames and passwords of consumers from third-party sources (e.g., through data breaches of third-party services that are not related to Roku)”</p></blockquote><p> According to Roku’s breach notice, 15,363 customer accounts were affected in this breach. The number of accounts that were hit by fraudulent purchases is unknown.</p><p> Sensitive materials, such as birthdays or full payment details, were not exposed in this breach. However, hackers are well aware that a successful username and password combination may be reused across several websites or services. You need to stop reusing passwords and consider using a <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-create-facebook-video-ads-with-free-video-creation-kit-for-2024/" >password manager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. I also suggest using <a class="link"   href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" >HaveIBeenPwned <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to see if your credentials have appeared in a public data breach.</p><p> Of course, customers can’t be blamed for this breach. Roku needs to take steps to prevent unauthorized account logins. If a Roku account can make purchases with a credit card, the account should be protected by two-factor authentication and other security systems. Roku currently offers two-factor authentication for its smart home products but does not provide the same protection for streaming accounts.</p><p> Roku published its <a class="link"   href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/Template%20Notification%203-8-2024.pdf" >data breach notice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on Friday, March 8th. This notice will be sent to affected customers, though Roku has already forced customers to reset their passwords. The company also says that it has identified and reversed fraudulent purchases. You may have received a refund for a fraudulent purchase without realizing it, though you should still take a few minutes to investigate your Roku account and associated credit card bill.</p><p> Source: <a class="link"   href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/Template%20Notification%203-8-2024.pdf" >Roku <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> via <a class="link"   href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-15-000-hacked-roku-accounts-sold-for-50-each-to-buy-hardware/" >Bleeping Computer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-step-by-step-guide-to-hulu-screen-capture-for-various-operating-systems/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Step-by-Step Guide to Hulu Screen Capture for Various Operating Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-flash-facts-how-videos-captivate-twitters-audience/"><u>[New] In 2024, Flash Facts How Videos Captivate Twitter's Audience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/anime-aficionados-alert-essential-streaming-platforms-for-your-viewing-pleasure/"><u>Anime Aficionados Alert: Essential Streaming Platforms for Your Viewing Pleasure</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/beyond-discover-exploring-the-future-of-personalized-playlists-with-spotifys-ai-integration/"><u>Beyond Discover: Exploring the Future of Personalized Playlists with Spotify's AI Integration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/boost-your-music-experience-the-amazing-spotify-client-hack-that-elevates-usage-to-new-heights/"><u>Boost Your Music Experience: The Amazing Spotify Client Hack That Elevates Usage to New Heights!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/cross-browser-retribution-by-youtube-a-5-second-delay-targeting-ad-blocker-devotees/"><u>Cross-Browser Retribution by YouTube: A 5-Second Delay Targeting Ad Blocker Devotees</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/discord-the-top-movie-enthusiasts-choice-of-streaming-platform/"><u>Discord: The Top Movie Enthusiast's Choice of Streaming Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/disneyplus-silently-disables-popular-groupwatch-functionality/"><u>Disney+ Silently Disables Popular GroupWatch Functionality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/effective-methods-to-exit-programs-on-your-google-smart-television/"><u>Effective Methods to Exit Programs on Your Google Smart Television</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/google-play-services-wont-update-12-fixes-are-here-on-oppo-find-x6-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Google Play Services Wont Update? 12 Fixes are Here on Oppo Find X6 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://common-error.techidaily.com/how-to-resolve-windows-network-error-code-0x800704cf/"><u>How to Resolve Windows Network Error Code 0X800704CF</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-reel-in-attention-by-emulating-tiktok-stardom-on-instagram/"><u>In 2024, Reel In Attention by Emulating TikTok Stardom on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/leading-ups-solutions-reviewed-the-definitive-guide/"><u>Leading UPS Solutions Reviewed: The Definitive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/the-top-5-android-apps-that-use-fingerprint-sensor-to-lock-your-apps-on-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-by-drfone-android/"><u>The Top 5 Android Apps That Use Fingerprint Sensor to Lock Your Apps On Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/tongue-treasures-selecting-superb-audio-to-text-applications/"><u>Tongue Treasures Selecting Superb Audio to Text Applications</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118314/7443" target="_top" id="2118314">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118314" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118314/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

    <title>Gentle Plea for Pause Functionality on Spotify - Need Some Silence!</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Gentle-Plea-for-Pause-Functionality-on-Spotify-Need-Some-Silence"><a href="#Gentle-Plea-for-Pause-Functionality-on-Spotify-Need-Some-Silence" class="headerlink" title="Gentle Plea for Pause Functionality on Spotify - Need Some Silence!"></a>Gentle Plea for Pause Functionality on Spotify - Need Some Silence!</h2><h3 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Spotify’s “Made For You” playlists are highly personalized but can lead to song repetition.</li><li>Streaming services like Pandora offer a “cooldown” feature to avoid repetitive songs.</li><li>Spotify needs to improve its algorithm or provide more control options for users.</li></ul><p> One of the main reasons why I continue to use Spotify is its music recommendation features. “Made For You” playlists take a lot of the guesswork out of finding something to play. However, once Spotify knows I like a song, it will play it over and over again. Sometimes, I just need a break.</p><h2 id="The-Problem"><a href="#The-Problem" class="headerlink" title="The Problem"></a>The Problem</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/spotify-song-in-playlist.png"                      alt="spotify song in playlist"                > </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-all-encompassing-review-djis-inspire-1-drone-for-2024/" >Spotify’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> “Made For You” playlists are, as you would expect, heavily geared toward your preferences. In fact, Spotify’s personalization probably goes deeper than you think.</p><p> A hyper-specific Spotify genre I recently discovered is called “Coastal Grandmother.” I sent Spotify’s “Coastal Grandmother Mix” playlist to a friend and we quickly realized the songs we were seeing were vastly different. On closer inspection, the playlist description says, “Coastal Grandmother music picked <em>just for you.</em>“ I didn’t expect a genre mix to be so personalized.</p><p> That’s exactly why songs can easily get repetitive if you listen to a lot of Spotify’s personalized playlists. For example, as I’m writing this, <a class="link"   href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/experts-selection-best-full-screen-recorders-for-pc-and-mac-for-2024/" >my Daylist <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is called “happy indie stomp and holler friday afternoon.” Without looking, I knew “Happy Idiot” by TV On The Radio was going to be in the playlist, and it was. Liking a song shouldn’t mean I’m destined to hear it every day of my life for the rest of time.</p><h2 id="The-Solution"><a href="#The-Solution" class="headerlink" title="The Solution"></a>The Solution</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-07-05_15-53-50.png"                      alt="Pandora I&#39;m tired of this song."                > </p><p> Streaming services figured out the solution to this problem a long time ago. <a class="link"   href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-shrouded-screen-images-techniques-for-redacting-info/" >Remember Pandora? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> It pioneered the concept of music recommendation when it launched all the way back in 2005. As far as I can tell, one of the original features was an option in the song menu called “I’m tired of this song.”</p><p> The beauty of this feature is you don’t have to make a permanent decision on the song. You can tap “I’m tired of this song,” and you won’t hear it again for a while. Eventually, it will come back into your rotation. Spotify only gives you the option to “<a class="link"   href="https://data-wizards.techidaily.com/mastering-multi-platform-presence-facebook-meets-linkedin-and-youtube/" >Hide this song <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“—and even that is only available on mobile.</p><p> There are very few songs that I dislike enough to want to remove them from my life permanently. And let’s be honest, I’m never going to remember to go back and undo that action a few months later. The “cooldown” approach is much more user-friendly and effective.</p><hr><p> I don’t know if Pandora has an ironclad patent on this feature or what—all I know is Spotify is killing me with repeat songs. Spotify is great at a lot of things, but if I’m angry when <em>songs I actually like</em> start playing, there’s a problem. <a class="link"   href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-tecno-spark-20-proplus-by-phone-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >Fix the algorithm <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or give us more controls, please.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-discreetly-discovering-content-how-to-read-instagram-stories-privately-on-pcandroidios/"><u>[New] In 2024, Discreetly Discovering Content How to Read Instagram Stories Privately on PC/Android/iOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-inside-out-of-t5-ultimate-sports-and-adventures-recorder/"><u>[New] In 2024, Inside Out of T5 Ultimate Sports and Adventures Recorder</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ransform-videos-affordable-high-quality-effs-in-2024/"><u>[New] Transform Videos - Affordable, High-Quality Effs, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-free-youtube-end-screen-resources-enhance-video-impact/"><u>[Updated] Free YouTube End Screen Resources - Enhance Video Impact</u></a></li><li><a href="https://graphic-issues.techidaily.com/lightning-cure-fast-remedy-for-amd-and-tarkov-bug/"><u>Lightning Cure: Fast Remedy for AMD & Tarkov Bug</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/nombre-de-los-dias-en-espanol-aprender-desde-martes-al-domingo/"><u>Nombre De Los Días en Español: Aprender Desde Martes Al Domingo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/the-monetization-matrix-how-maker-gains-from-shorter-videos/"><u>The Monetization Matrix How Maker Gains From Shorter Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/ultimate-video-guide-to-hairstyles/"><u>Ultimate Video Guide to Hairstyles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/unlock-savings-with-directtv-stream-secure-your-90-off-deal-today-only-dont-miss-out/"><u>Unlock Savings with DirectTV Stream - Secure Your $90 Off Deal Today Only – Don't Miss Out!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/unlock-the-full-potential-of-your-videos-on-youtube-discover-why-a-paid-membership-is-worth-it/"><u>Unlock the Full Potential of Your Videos on YouTube - Discover Why a Paid Membership Is Worth It!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/unplug-your-vizio-smart-tv-essential-steps-to-safely-severing-its-internet-connection/"><u>Unplug Your Vizio Smart TV: Essential Steps to Safely Severing Its Internet Connection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/upcoming-changes-in-disneyplus-policy-end-of-shared-access-era-approaching/"><u>Upcoming Changes in Disney+ Policy: End of Shared Access Era Approaching</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/why-invest-in-online-radio-even-with-the-rise-of-spotify-and-apple-music/"><u>Why Invest in Online Radio Even with the Rise of Spotify and Apple Music</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135361/19272" target="_top" id="2135361">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135361" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135361/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

When you buy a movie on disc, you’ll get a code that will unlock a copy of the same movie on an online streaming service. The exact service will differ from one movie distributor to the next, but most of the ones I’ve seen are for <a class="link"   href="https://www.vudu.com/" >VUDU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> aka “Fandango At Home.” Regardless, the voucher will tell you where to go in order to redeem your movie.</p><h2 id="Where-To-Find-Your-Voucher"><a href="#Where-To-Find-Your-Voucher" class="headerlink" title="Where To Find Your Voucher"></a>Where To Find Your Voucher</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/42775e18.jpg"                      alt="Collection of Blu Ray Movies stacked on a table"                > </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/south-wales-uk-02-16-2021-1918061810" >SarahJayne91 &#x2F; Shutterstock.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/south-wales-uk-02-16-2021-1918061810" >SarahJayne91&#x2F;Shutterstock.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><p> The exact location of the movie voucher also depends on how the disc was packaged. It’s usually inside the disc case itself as a loose paper in the stack of promotional material many movies have. Some people never even take that pack of papers out of the case, and others might throw it all away without checking first! So now’s a good time to walk over to your collection of physical movies, and check each case to see if you have a digital voucher for any of them.

So if you’re checking out thrift shops, pawn shops, or garage sales, you could get something extra. Now, some of these vouchers do have expiration dates set a few years after the movie’s release on disc, but there’s no harm in trying out a code to see if it still works.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123735/7443" target="_top" id="2123735">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123735" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123735/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="You-Can-Check-Which-Movies-Have-Vouchers-Online"><a href="#You-Can-Check-Which-Movies-Have-Vouchers-Online" class="headerlink" title="You Can Check Which Movies Have Vouchers Online"></a>You Can Check Which Movies Have Vouchers Online</h2><p> While it’s not advertised as heavily anymore, you can usually see whether a movie comes with a complementary digital copy by taking a look at its product description. Phrases like “Digital Copy Included,” “Blu-ray + Digital HD,” or “Digital HD with UltraViolet” are common indicators that you’re getting to double-dip with your purchase.</p><h2 id="There-Are-a-Lot-of-Cheap-New-Discs-Out-There"><a href="#There-Are-a-Lot-of-Cheap-New-Discs-Out-There" class="headerlink" title="There Are a Lot of Cheap New Discs Out There"></a>There Are a Lot of Cheap New Discs Out There</h2><p> With the <a class="link"   href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-innovative-ways-to-leverage-zoom-for-fb-live/" >decline in popularity of physical media <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, there’s (ironically) never been a better time to get in on the physical movie collection hobby. Why? Because if you peruse online stores that sell movies on disc, you’ll notice a heap of cheap old stock that must go. If you check out<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Copy-DVD/b?ie=UTF8&node=721726011&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003301&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/before-you-buy-a-digital-movie-check-the-physical-version-for-a-voucher/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >Amazon’s section on complementary digital copies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you’ll see plenty of great titles going for under ten bucks.</p><p> I really like to look out for movies like this, because it means that I can get a preserved physical copy of the movie, never wear it out, and still watch my collection with the convenience of online digital streaming, without worrying that my digital copy will disappear when the service ends, or the company goes out of business. That’s probably inevitable, but since I still have the disc, it’s <a class="link"   href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-solutions-for-samsung-galaxy-m34-5g-unlock-without-password-by-drfone-android/" >likely to outlast me <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, much less the servers holding ghostly copies of our movies.</p><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139114/17108" target="_top" id="2139114">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139114" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139114/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Beware-of-Region-Locks"><a href="#Beware-of-Region-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Beware of Region Locks"></a>Beware of Region Locks</h2><p> There’s one last wrinkle to the whole complementary digital copy deal that I think everyone should know. While it’s not going to affect most folks in the US, if you live outside the US like I do, then you’re likely to run into regional issues. For example, VUDU isn’t available in my region, so any movie I buy that comes with a VUDU code won’t work. At least, not unless you use a VPN to change your region. It is a little irritating that a voucher that comes with a disc for my region would have a voucher that isn’t, but I guess it’s not the end of the world. It’s just something you should be aware of if you’re not in the right territory.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-google-meet-screen-record-tips-for-iphoneandroid-users/"><u>[Updated] Google Meet Screen Record Tips for iPhone/Android Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-getting-the-pokemon-go-gps-signal-not-found-11-error-in-honor-play-8t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>In 2024, Getting the Pokemon Go GPS Signal Not Found 11 Error in Honor Play 8T | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-enable-usb-debugging-on-a-locked-realme-c67-4g-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Enable USB Debugging on a Locked Realme C67 4G Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/netflix-borrow-some-inspiration-from-spotifys-a-list/"><u>Netflix, Borrow Some Inspiration From Spotify's A-List!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/nintendo-switch-a-comprehensive-guide-to-available-streaming-options/"><u>Nintendo Switch: A Comprehensive Guide to Available Streaming Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/no-regrets-purchase-popular-tv-episodes-as-physical-copies-now/"><u>No Regrets: Purchase Popular TV Episodes as Physical Copies Now!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/overcome-far-cry-5s-constant-boot-loop-with-these-expert-hacks/"><u>Overcome Far Cry 5'S Constant Boot Loop with These Expert Hacks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/pause-in-venu-online-sports-broadcast-what-you-need-to-know/"><u>Pause in Venu Online Sports Broadcast: What You Need to Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/forming-ideas-into-engaging-youtube-video-plans-for-2024/"><u>Transforming Ideas Into Engaging YouTube Video Plans for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/unseen-influences-on-your-viewing-habits-of-stories-for-2024/"><u>Unseen Influences on Your Viewing Habits of Stories for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

None of the above. I prefer to buy my music outright and listen to it offline—and I’m not talking about vinyl or CDs. That’s right, I still buy MP3s. Considering how many online music stores remain around, I’m not alone. I can’t speak for others, but here’s why I haven’t made the switch to streaming.</p><h2 id="I-Can-Use-Any-App-or-Device-I-Want"><a href="#I-Can-Use-Any-App-or-Device-I-Want" class="headerlink" title="I Can Use Any App or Device I Want"></a>I Can Use Any App or Device I Want</h2><p>Close </p><p> Back in the heyday of the iPod, I remember browsing through alternative portable MP3 players. The software helped determine which model to pick over another. Companies were experimenting with different ways to interact with our music libraries, and it was fun.</p><p> Now, experimentation has shifted to apps on our phones. I can swap out music apps at any time, and it feels like getting my hands on a brand new MP3 player (short of <a class="link"   href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-use-pokemon-go-joystick-on-itel-p55t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >actually buying a modern MP3 player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>).</p><p> For a while, the open-source <a class="link"   href="https://f-droid.org/packages/org.oxycblt.auxio/" >Auxio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> music player (pictured above) has been my favorite app for the job. It has a great app icon and flows nicely with Android’s Material You vibe, in addition to having all the features I’m looking for. When I’m using a Samsung Galaxy phone, I like the consistency of <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004120/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.app.music" >Samsung Music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Yet just for fun, I hopped into the Play Store and downloaded <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004120/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frolo.musp" >Frolomuse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, just to see how different a layout I could find—this one’s pretty dope.</p><p>Close </p><p> I also like having the ability to dump MP3s onto a flash drive and stick them into the USB port of my car. This is easy enough to do, and I’m not beholden to <a class="link"   href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-apple-iphone-xr-asking-for-passcode-after-ios-1714-update-what-to-do-by-drfone-ios/" >Spotify supporting a niche product <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to make it happen. Then, I can listen to music regardless of an internet connection, and I eliminate the need for Bluetooth as well. I live in a rural area and regularly drive through other rural parts of the state. Perpetual internet access is not something I take for granted.</p><p> Streaming apps control the entirety of their listening experience. You can only stream through their apps on supported platforms, and if you don’t like their app design, tough luck. If they make a change you don’t like, you’re stuck with it. That, to me, is a worse experience than the one I grew up with. But being able to swap out apps? That’s pretty cool.</p><h2 id="I-Enjoy-Building-a-Music-Library"><a href="#I-Enjoy-Building-a-Music-Library" class="headerlink" title="I Enjoy Building a Music Library"></a>I Enjoy Building a Music Library</h2><p>Close </p><p> I like to collect things, but it’s not the acquisition alone that’s fun. It’s the curation. I like browsing through a selection, deciding which tracks I want to “take home with me,” and building up over time a library of music I’m able to listen to.</p><p> I like seeing how this library changes with time. While I may not keep the same songs I listened to in high school, college, or the early years of my marriage on my phone at all times, I do still own them. The songs on my phone today reflect ways in which I’ve changed, and the handful of albums that have stuck around reflect some of the ways I haven’t.</p><p> I feel a more personal connection to music this way than I do on streaming platforms, where I can instantly play any song at any time. This is a subjective matter, I know. Spotify users look forward to the <a class="link"   href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-premier-mobile-devices-top-gba-game-players/" >year’s summary of what they’ve listened to <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. They share playlists that reflect their creativity. As for me, I prefer to cobble together a collection of music that I can carry around as my own.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1770526">                    <video width="240" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770526.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1770526">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770526.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftokenmetrics.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1770526%2F20702'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1770526/20702"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="It-Feels-Good-to-Support-Artists-Directly"><a href="#It-Feels-Good-to-Support-Artists-Directly" class="headerlink" title="It Feels Good to Support Artists Directly"></a>It Feels Good to Support Artists Directly</h2><p> We feel close to our favorite musicians despite never meeting them. Their words and melodies form the soundtrack to our lives. There are ways we can give back to them, but one of the most straightforward methods is to pay them.</p><p> Buying an album outright is a way I can put a few bucks into the hands of my favorite musicians, regardless of how often I play their songs. If I buy several albums, I have a general idea of how much money makes it to the musician after the storefront takes its cut, especially in the case of independent music. Bandcamp even gives me the option to name my own price if I feel inclined to toss in a little extra.</p><p> Sure, it’s not a perfect system, and record labels screwed over artists long before streaming platforms took their place. Still, it’s a system where people selling music get to set their own prices and have at least some say in how much they make.</p><h2 id="Opting-Out-of-the-Streaming-Business-Model"><a href="#Opting-Out-of-the-Streaming-Business-Model" class="headerlink" title="Opting Out of the Streaming Business Model"></a>Opting Out of the Streaming Business Model</h2><p> Streaming services don’t exactly pay musicians. Or rather, they don’t pay much. The biggest stars with millions of streams are able to make a good living, but many find themselves making less than they did from the days when most fans bought CDs. Streaming is an opaque system where musicians get paid fractions of a penny whenever we click the play button next to their song or their track pops up in a playlist.</p><p> If the streaming platform’s relationship with musicians were my only gripe, that would be disincentive enough to sign up, but I don’t like the streaming platform’s relationship with me, either.</p><p> With digital storefronts like <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/" >iTunes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/MP3-Music-Download/b?node=163856011&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004120&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/streaming-is-great-but-heres-why-i-prefer-to-buy-mp3s/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >Amazon Music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://us.7digital.com/" >7digital <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="http://magnatune.com/" >Magnatune <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, I can buy music outright. I give them money and walk away with MP3s that I can use as I wish. How often I listen to them, no one knows. Whether I put them on my phone or a portable MP3 player, no one knows that either. No one’s monitoring my listening habits, taking note of which songs I use to help me wake up, which allow me to focus during work, and which pick me up when I’m down.</p><p> In many ways, <a class="link"   href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-change-credit-card-from-your-iphone-se-2020-apple-id-and-apple-pay-by-drfone-ios/" >Spotify is now a social network <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. I don’t like having my behavior monitored and logged. I don’t like being so explicitly manipulated. Algorithms have made social media toxic and turned YouTube into a risky place to browse. I don’t want them steering my music, either.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130533/26400" target="_top" id="2130533">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130533" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130533/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="If-I-Cancel-a-Subscription-I’m-Left-With-Nothing"><a href="#If-I-Cancel-a-Subscription-I’m-Left-With-Nothing" class="headerlink" title="If I Cancel a Subscription, I’m Left With Nothing"></a>If I Cancel a Subscription, I’m Left With Nothing</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/340cfeb4.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Music banner on the Pixel 4 XL"                > </p><p>Cameron Summerson &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> With streaming platforms, I hand over ownership of my music, the freedom to listen to those songs wherever I want, give someone permission to log all of my listening habits and open myself up to manipulation by an algorithm. Then, if I decide I’m done with this relationship and cancel my subscription, I’m left with nothing.</p><p> If I were to take the hundreds of dollars I would give Spotify and buy music instead, I’d have tracks I can listen to for the rest of my life (and with <a class="link"   href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/essential-list-high-quality-cost-free-meeting-platforms/" >Spotify’s price hikes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, hitting a hundred dollars doesn’t take long). Say times get hard, and I need to cut back on how much money is going out the door. I’m not left fretting about losing my workout music or the tracks I play in the background to help me concentrate as I make more money. I could lose my car and my home, but as long as I have a phone or even just a pocket for a flash drive, I still have my music.</p><hr><p> Downloading versus streaming sounds like a simple matter of personal preference, but these are questions of ownership, control, and respect.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Betas-Launch-Kodi-21-OMEGA-Reaches-Milestone-with-Initial-Public-Testing-Phase"><a href="#Betas-Launch-Kodi-21-OMEGA-Reaches-Milestone-with-Initial-Public-Testing-Phase" class="headerlink" title="Betas Launch: Kodi 21 OMEGA Reaches Milestone with Initial Public Testing Phase"></a>Betas Launch: Kodi 21 OMEGA Reaches Milestone with Initial Public Testing Phase</h2><p>The Kodi 21 “Omega” update is finally available in Beta. This release boosts Kodi’s performance and offers several improvements, including greater Dolby Vision compatibility. Unfortunately, Kodi 21 ends support for Windows 7 and 8.0—subsequent Windows releases, including Windows 8.1, are still supported.</p><p> Most of the changes introduced in Kodi 21 were <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-crafting-your-online-identity-a-facebook-tutorial/" >announced in April 2023 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. At that time, Kodi also launched the first Kodi 21 Alpha build, which contained plenty of bugs and wasn’t intended for average users. This new Beta release is also somewhat buggy and “will most likely break things,” according to Kodi. Some skins and other customizations will also be affected. If you’re happy with your current Kodi installation, don’t bother with Kodi 21 until a stable release is available.</p><p> Anyway, here’s a quick summary of what Kodi 21 has to offer: an upstream version of FFmpeg 6.0 adds new encoders and decoders (while also making future updates easier), Dolby Vision detection and compatibility are greatly improved, Kodi finally gains support for M3U8 playlist files, and channel groups can now be sorted in PVR. Several longstanding bugs are now resolved on macOS, Kodi audio playback is more reliable on Linux, and Windows gets a boost in SMB read speed, plus expanded DXVA2 AV1 hardware video decoding capabilities. Subtitle bugs that were discovered in Kodi 20 are also fixed.</p><p> The Kodi 21 Beta resolves some problems that were encountered in the final Alpha build, including buggy favorites behavior. That said, there are still some hiccups. The Kodi team points out two notable problems that may turn users away from this Beta release—multi-part MP4 files aren’t behaving properly on Android, and FFmpeg issue has temporarily broken OGG music playback. Additional issues (submitted by early testers) are <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/issues" >listed on GitHub <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and you’ll find some complaints on the <a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kodi/" >r&#x2F;Kodi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> subreddit.</p><p> To install the Kodi 21 “Omega” Beta, visit the <a class="link"   href="https://kodi.tv/download/" >Kodi downloads page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, select your platform of choice, and navigate to the prerelease downloads section.

While not all smart TVs are bad, they can come with several caveats that will make you nostalgic for your old “dumb” TV. I’m keeping mine around, and maybe you should, too.</p><h2 id="What-Is-a-Dumb-TV"><a href="#What-Is-a-Dumb-TV" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Dumb TV?"></a>What Is a Dumb TV?</h2><p> Dumb TVs are what TVs were before we got the bright idea of connecting them to the internet. They don’t have operating systems, there are no apps, and definitely no smart features like voice control or screen mirroring. You simply turn it on, connect your input, and watch whatever you want.</p><p> These days, not many, if any, TV manufacturers still make Dumb TVs, and the ones that still exist are usually missing key features like 4K video or Dolby Atmos. So, why would you want a TV with fewer instead of more features? Here are six reasons why a dumb TV is a better experience than a smart TV.</p><h2 id="The-Ads-on-Smart-TVs-Will-Only-Get-Worse"><a href="#The-Ads-on-Smart-TVs-Will-Only-Get-Worse" class="headerlink" title="The Ads on Smart TVs Will Only Get Worse"></a>The Ads on Smart TVs Will Only Get Worse<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/screenshot_20240725-081835.png"                      alt="Google TV home screen."                ></h2><p> Having a smart TV means making your peace with ads. Manufacturers try to justify putting ads on your TV by saying that the ad revenue they earn helps to subsidize the cost of production and keep prices low. But that’s a little hard to believe when even the high-end TVs—the ones that cost several thousand dollars, still get ads.</p><p> But let’s forget that for a moment and accept that ads are an inescapable reality of smart TVs. Personally, I don’t mind them much so long as they are restricted to the home screen and I can easily blast past them.</p><p> The problem, however, is that these ads are quickly becoming obnoxious, and they show no sign of slowing down.</p><p> For example, in 2022, Vizio started experimenting with what it called “jump ads.” They worked like this: Say you were watching a broadcast of MasterChef on your local FOX channel. Your Vizio TV would analyze your screen, identify the show, and crosscheck it against the content library of streaming services on its OS. If the show were available on Netflix, for example, Vizio would then show an ad encouraging you to watch subsequent episodes of MasterChef on demand on Netflix. In essence, your TV would generate and insert new ads into your live shows in addition to the ones you already have to suffer through on cable.</p><p> As if that wasn’t bad enough, a few months ago, Roku stepped things up a notch and filed a patent that would allow them to show ads on your TV whenever it’s idle, regardless of whether you’re streaming a show on Netflix, playing a game on your PS5, or even watching a DVD.</p><p> That is way too far. I can put up with a few ads tucked into small corners, but turning my TV into a glorified billboard every time I step away for 30 seconds is a big no-no for me.</p><h2 id="Smart-TVs-Can-Dictate-How-You-Watch-TV"><a href="#Smart-TVs-Can-Dictate-How-You-Watch-TV" class="headerlink" title="Smart TVs Can Dictate How You Watch TV"></a>Smart TVs Can Dictate How You Watch TV</h2><p> Smart TVs do a lot of behind-the-scenes work to deliver the picture you see on your screen. Usually, this results in a sharper and clearer image, but sometimes, all that extra processing can actually make things worse. And now, you might not even have the option to turn it off.</p><p> Recently, some Roku TV users found themselves in this exact situation. After a software update, they discovered that “motion smoothing” had been turned on with no way to disable it. Motion smoothing is a feature that adds extra frames to make a show match your TV’s refresh rate, but the results can be hit or miss. To fix the issue, users had to try various workarounds, and when that failed, wait for Roku to release another update.</p><p> In this case, it seems like the situation was more of a glitch than Roku intentionally forcing their preferences on you. But it does make you wonder: What’s to stop your smart TV manufacturer from deciding how they think you should experience your favorite shows?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135400/19272" target="_top" id="2135400">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135400" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135400/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Your-Smart-TV-Is-Watching-You"><a href="#Your-Smart-TV-Is-Watching-You" class="headerlink" title="Your Smart TV Is Watching You"></a>Your Smart TV Is Watching You<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/smart-tv-spying-with-eyes.jpg"                      alt="Smart TV spying with eyes looking at people on the couch."                ></h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134501/19576" target="_top" id="2134501">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134501" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134501/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a class="link"   href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/exploring-the-universe-with-vive-cosmos-top-contender-in-todays-virtual-reality-arena/" >Smart TVs can be just as bad as your phone or PC when it comes to collecting and sharing your data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. For example, smart TVs that come with voice control features record what you say and sometimes forward those recordings to third parties for remote processing. Given that we usually mount our TVs in our living spaces where we receive guests, hang out with our family, or just gossip with friends, it’s a little frightening to think about what they may have accidentally overheard.</p><p> Even if they aren’t recording everything you say, <a class="link"   href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/unlock-pro-quality-videos-gopro-quik-editing-on-macbook-made-simple-for-2024/" >smart TVs are still watching you <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the sense that they are tracking your TV-watching habits. With automatic content recognition (ACR), they can identify what shows you’re watching, whether it’s on cable, Netflix, or Blu-ray, and from there, make deductions about your interests, political affiliations, and even income bracket. They then combine this data with other information about you, such as your sex, age, and marital status, to create a profile of you. They sell this profile to analytics and ad companies, who in turn use it to craft ads targeted at you.</p><p> Your TV collecting and selling information about you may sound like the beginning of a dystopian movie, but it is a perfectly legal business, provided you consent. And guess what? You probably already did without realizing it. Those terms and conditions you agreed to when setting up your TV for the first time likely contained some legal jargon about consenting to your TV gathering and sharing data about you.</p><p> However, if it’s any consolation, you can revoke that consent at any time and <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-tips-and-tricks-for-locating-recent-videos-youve-liked/" >stop your smart TV from spying on you <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Smart-TVs-Have-a-Short-Shelf-Life"><a href="#Smart-TVs-Have-a-Short-Shelf-Life" class="headerlink" title="Smart TVs Have a Short Shelf Life"></a>Smart TVs Have a Short Shelf Life<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/853aa658.jpg"                      alt="paramount plus app running on google tv"                ></h2><p> If I’m going to spend thousands of dollars on a new TV, I expect to get at least double-digit years of value out of it <a class="link"   href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-the-easy-path-to-observing-well-liked-comments-on-the-video-platform/" >before it needs replacing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Unfortunately, smart TVs just don’t have that kind of longevity, and there are two main reasons why.</p><p> Firstly, as with any smart device, you need to constantly update your TV to ensure that it remains compatible with your favorite streaming apps. Unfortunately, smart TVs are not renowned for frequent software updates. Even the best ones tend to max out at five years of support. So, what happens when your favorite streaming service requires you to update your TV to use the app? 2011 Samsung TV users learned this the hard way when Netflix was suddenly no longer supported on their TVs in 2019.</p><p> Secondly, smart TVs occasionally experience software glitches, and your TV can easily become a glorified wall decoration because of a faulty update or a badly timed power outage. In one example of this, some TCL Roku TV users woke up to find their TVs bricked after a simple update. Sometimes, the problems can be resolved with a little tech support, but other times, there’s nothing left to do but take the TV to the recycling center.</p><h2 id="Smart-TVs-Can-Introduce-Security-Vulnerabilities"><a href="#Smart-TVs-Can-Introduce-Security-Vulnerabilities" class="headerlink" title="Smart TVs Can Introduce Security Vulnerabilities"></a>Smart TVs Can Introduce Security Vulnerabilities</h2><p> Another gripe I have with smart TVs is that they introduce a fresh set of security vulnerabilities. I have already mentioned that smart TVs don’t get many years of software updates. A spillover effect of their aging software is that they are vulnerable to malicious actors. It wouldn’t take much for a determined hacker to bypass their security protection and gain control of your TV.</p><p> Once in, a hacker could do immense damage. They could record you through your TV and blackmail you with sextortion scams, listen in on private conversations, and use the information they gather in phishing scams, or steal your personal information and sell it to other malicious actors.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130873/7443" target="_top" id="2130873">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130873" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130873/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Smart-TVs-Have-Slow-and-Clunky-Interfaces"><a href="#Smart-TVs-Have-Slow-and-Clunky-Interfaces" class="headerlink" title="Smart TVs Have Slow and Clunky Interfaces"></a>Smart TVs Have Slow and Clunky Interfaces</h2><p> While some smart TVs run on Android, many others use proprietary operating systems. However, the bitter truth is that TV companies are hardware manufacturers, not software developers, and most times, that shows. Many TV OSs are not fluid or intuitive, and they can be extremely clunky to use.</p><p> It also doesn’t help that <a class="link"   href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-infinite-jest-joyride-top-kids-game-lineup/" >your smart TV is too dumb to be smart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. By this, I mean that the hardware on which it runs is grossly underpowered, and as time passes, it will start to suffer under the strain. That means a choppy OS, lag, and sometimes total unresponsiveness. Just a few years after you purchase a smart TV, navigating the home screen can be frustrating enough to make you want to scream.</p><h2 id="My-Other-Devices-Are-Smarter-Than-Most-Smart-TVs"><a href="#My-Other-Devices-Are-Smarter-Than-Most-Smart-TVs" class="headerlink" title="My Other Devices Are Smarter Than Most Smart TVs"></a>My Other Devices Are Smarter Than Most Smart TVs<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/an-android-tv-with-an-apple-tv-roku-amazon-fire-tv-and-chromecast-positioned-in-front.jpg"                      alt="An Android TV with an Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, and Chromecast positioned in front."                ></h2><p> Perhaps the most offensive thing about smart TVs is that they just rehash the same features my other devices already do, only worse. For example, <a class="link"   href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/navigating-around-key-errors-mastering-content-creation-with-chatgpt/" >you can stream your favorite movies from your game console <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, with arguably better quality than on a smart TV.</p><p> The same goes for streaming boxes and sticks. These are even more appealing options because they actually have capable hardware, don’t cost an arm and a leg, and are easily replaceable if they stop providing value.</p><hr><p> These days, it’s practically impossible to buy a decent TV that doesn’t ask for your Wi-Fi password. If you’ve got an old TV covered in dust somewhere, this is your sign to take better care of it. With how manufacturers are phasing out dumb TVs, you might just have treasure in your hands.

NBC will broadcast many daytime and primetime events. With the aid of an over-the-air (OTA) antenna, you can watch for free.</p><h2 id="Which-Channels-are-Broadcasting-the-Olympics"><a href="#Which-Channels-are-Broadcasting-the-Olympics" class="headerlink" title="Which Channels are Broadcasting the Olympics?"></a>Which Channels are Broadcasting the Olympics?</h2><p> NBCUniversal networks are the home of the 2024 Summer Olympics. During the day, NBC will air <a class="link"   href="https://www.peacocktv.com/blog/2024-olympics-events-to-stream-live-on-peacock" >at least nine hours <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of event coverage. If you have a local NBC affiliate in your area (and you almost certainly do), this is where you can <a class="link"   href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-a-non-functioning-steelseries-arctis-pro-microphone-complete-solution/" >watch a lot of free events with an OTA antenna <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Once daytime coverage concludes, the network will use the primetime hours to show highlights of the day’s events.</p><p> In addition to NBC, you will find some Olympics content streaming on the Peacock app, GOLF Channel, USA Network, CNBC, and E!. Telemundo will air Spanish-language coverage. However, Peacock and the extended range of NBCUniversal channels are not accessible via antenna and can get expensive due to price creep.</p><h2 id="How-Do-I-Watch-for-Free"><a href="#How-Do-I-Watch-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="How Do I Watch for Free?"></a>How Do I Watch for Free?</h2><p> OTA antennae pick up free broadcast frequencies, allowing you to tune into television stations without paid cable. Depending on where you live, you may be able to access a handful of local channels or a wider range of HD networks. You are likely to have access to NBC.</p><p> There are <a class="link"   href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-crossing-platforms-upload-video-to-twittertumblr/" >several web tools you can use <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to see which networks are available to you via antenna based on your zip code. You can also use the map to see how strong the signal is for a specific channel and how much range your antenna needs.</p><p> Most modern televisions have an integrated tuner, meaning they are ready to be connected to an antenna. This makes setting up an antenna to watch the 2024 Olympics a lot easier than it might sound.</p><h2 id="Setting-Up-an-Antenna"><a href="#Setting-Up-an-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="Setting Up an Antenna"></a>Setting Up an Antenna</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/52815640483_03eaabec66_o.jpg"                      alt="Person holding an indoor TV antenna"                > </p><p>Jordan Gloor &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> When you think of a TV antenna, you may envision a set of metal rabbit ears. But these days, indoor digital antennae often resemble an internet router or speaker. Some antenna models even have sleek, flat designs that are easy to mount indoors to a wall. Outdoor antennae are designed to be mounted on your roof and are typically much larger with a wider range.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unwinding-watchlists-youtubes-route-for-playback-in-opposite-direction/" >Setting up an antenna <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> may be as easy as plugging the device into the integrated tuner on the back of your TV. Once the two devices are connected, you are typically required to turn on your television and allow it to scan for channels. Each antenna may have slightly different setup instructions.</p><p> Keep in mind that you want to be careful about antenna placement to get better reception. As a general rule, you’ll want to avoid placing your antenna so that there is an obstacle in the way of the signal. If you’re placing an indoor antenna, put it high up on the wall near a window if you can.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136621/26400" target="_top" id="2136621">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136621" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136621/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Which-Olympic-Events-I-Can-Watch-for-Free"><a href="#Which-Olympic-Events-I-Can-Watch-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Which Olympic Events I Can Watch for Free?"></a>Which Olympic Events I Can Watch for Free?</h2><p> You will be able to watch NBC Olympics coverage using an antenna in most places.

YouTube will soon start delivering longer ads, which no one wants. However, the good news is you’ll experience fewer interruptions as the company won’t show as many.</p><p> In a quick <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/14314822?sjid=14587981969958620562-NA" >announcement this week <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, YouTube’s Director of Product Management for Ads, Romana Pawar, confirmed that the company wants to deliver a “better streaming experience” with fewer ad breaks. That way, you won’t constantly have to deal with ads at the beginning, during, and after watching content on the platform. But when you do see an ad, it’ll be longer than usual.</p><p> While explaining the change, YouTube said, “79% of viewers would prefer video ads that are grouped together instead of distributed throughout a video.” And based on that preference, fewer but longer ads are now rolling out around the globe.</p><p> YouTube started testing the change earlier this year and is now rolling it out to all TVs. The countdown timer in the bottom corner of the screen during ad breaks will be longer, but at least you won’t have to deal with it as frequently. And yes, you’ll still be able to skip ads, but you’ll need to wait longer than the usual 5-10 seconds. To be clear, this is for the YouTube app on a smart TV, Roku streaming devices, Google TV, and similar devices, not your smartphone.</p><p> I’m okay with this change as it means fewer interruptions when watching longer videos on YouTube. However, the announcement also confirmed the company is expanding ads to YouTube Shorts on TV. Like watching Shorts on your phone or tablet, you’ll now see skippable ads between Shorts on the television.</p><p> No one likes ads, so many have turned to ad blockers, but <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-edge-video-editing-programs-for-instagram-on-android/" >Google quickly started fighting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> those.

A similar feature is available on YouTube Music, where you can create your own radio station featuring your favorite artists. You also get the option to configure the level of song discovery between Familiar, Blend, and Discover. Furthermore, you can apply different filters like Popular, New releases, and Deep cuts.</p><p> To create a personalized radio station, tap the plus icon under the “Your Music Tuner” option on the YouTube Music homepage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/your-music-tuner-option-in-youtube-music.jpg"                      alt="Your music tuner option in YouTube Music."                > </p><p> Select the artists of your choice.

This is because YouTube is the go-to platform for many artists to upload their songs. As a result, all the songs uploaded to YouTube are also available on YouTube Music.</p><p> This means that even if your friend uploaded a music video on YouTube with very few views, you can still find it on YouTube Music. However, this isn’t the case with other music streaming services like Spotify and <a class="link"   href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/most-asked-questions-about-pokemon-go-battle-league-rewards-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/" >Apple Music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These platforms typically only focus on music with some level of popularity.</p><hr><p> These were some of the best YouTube Music features that made me switch to YouTube Music as my default music streaming platform. For you, some other YouTube Music features might be interesting. Perhaps you’d like the Quick Picks or the Offline Mixtape feature. But at the end of the day, YouTube Music is definitely a top contender, and you should definitely check it out.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-steps-to-resolve-stuck-obs-camera-feed/"><u>[New] In 2024, Steps to Resolve Stuck OBS Camera Feed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mac-recording-hub-essential-insights/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Mac Recording Hub Essential Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-top-10-scriptural-ringtone-selections-for-faith-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Top 10 Scriptural Ringtone Selections for Faith for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unveiling-the-elite-free-srt-translation-websites-of-choice/"><u>2024 Approved Unveiling the Elite Free SRT Translation Websites of Choice</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/comparing-the-most-popular-linux-snapshots-tools-for-2024/"><u>Comparing the Most Popular Linux Snapshots Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/effective-solutions-how-to-stop-the-surge-2-from-continuously-crashing/"><u>Effective Solutions: How to Stop The Surge 2 From Continuously Crashing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/exclusive-access-fee-how-spotify-is-monetizing-your-love-for-lyrics/"><u>Exclusive Access Fee: How Spotify Is Monetizing Your Love for Lyrics!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/exploring-hdmi-21-features-is-it-time-to-consider-an-upgrade/"><u>Exploring HDMI 2.1 Features: Is It Time to Consider an Upgrade?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/fubotv-discontinues-19-major-discovery-networks-what-you-need-to-know/"><u>FuboTV Discontinues 19 Major Discovery Networks: What You Need to Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-jailbreak-icloud-locked-iphone-8-plus-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone 8 Plus</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/transforming-3d-design-to-production-with-chatgpt-insights/"><u>Transforming 3D Design to Production with ChatGPT Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/what-is-geo-blocking-and-how-to-bypass-it-on-samsung-galaxy-xcover-6-pro-tactical-edition-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>What is Geo-Blocking and How to Bypass it On Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition? | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Beyond-Discover-Exploring-the-Future-of-Personalized-Playlists-with-Spotify’s-AI-Integration"><a href="#Beyond-Discover-Exploring-the-Future-of-Personalized-Playlists-with-Spotify’s-AI-Integration" class="headerlink" title="Beyond Discover: Exploring the Future of Personalized Playlists with Spotify’s AI Integration"></a>Beyond Discover: Exploring the Future of Personalized Playlists with Spotify’s AI Integration</h2><p>Like every other company, Spotify is exploring artificial intelligence to improve its product. The latest Spotify beta feature leverages AI to turn any text prompt into a personalized playlist.</p><p> While most users turn to Discover to help find new music, up-and-coming artists, or music that fits their preferred style, Spotify wants to kick things up a notch. After experimenting with an <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-amplify-your-videos-reach-perfect-title-description-and-tags-for-2024/" >AI DJ feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> last year, a new “AI Playlist” is slowly rolling out to Premium subscribers in select regions.</p><p> The new Spotify AI Playlist is currently available in the UK and Australia. It transforms a quick line of text into a playlist full of new music. Users on Android or iOS can access the AI Playlist feature by opening “My Library,” tapping on the “+” button, and selecting “AI Playlists”. Spotify suggests that if you’re looking for “an indie folk playlist to give my brain a big warm hug” or “a playlist that makes you feel like the main character,” try AI Playlists and see what happens.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/spotify-ai-playlist-tool.png"                      alt="Spotify AI playlist tool"                > </p><p>Spotify</p><p> According to Spotify, this new AI tool is pretty smart and will accept prompts about animals, places, feelings, movie characters, activities, and much more. Once you issue a prompt, it’ll deliver a specially curated playlist of up to 30 songs to match the vibe or energy you’ve requested.</p><p> More importantly, Spotify claims you can fine-tune the results by deleting songs or adding additional prompts to get the perfect playlist. Once you’re satisfied, hit “create,” and you’ll be all set to start streaming. In closing, Spotify mentioned that while AI playlists are “designed to be fun, the tool is still in beta and won’t produce results for non-music-related prompts, like current events or specific brands. We also have measures in place around prompts that are offensive—so please prompt responsibly!”</p><p> It’s been a busy year for Spotify, with new <a class="link"   href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/the-magnificent-art-of-pokemon-go-streaming-on-samsung-galaxy-xcover-7-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >video learning courses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/overcoming-windows-update-failures-strategies-for-error-0x30017/" >audiobook membership <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a new <a class="link"   href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-messages-from-apple-iphone-14-pro-max-to-other-iphone-all-ios-versions-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/" >mini player for desktops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and even <a class="link"   href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-gain-an-edge-access-these-top-8-sites-for-free-eco-screen-backdrops-and-clips-for-2024/" >adding music videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the platform.

If you’re looking to watch free movies online, here are our picks for the best options.</p><h2 id="Tubi"><a href="#Tubi" class="headerlink" title="Tubi"></a>Tubi</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tubi.png"                      alt="Tubi"                > </p><p><em>Tubi</em></p><p> It’s hard to argue with the vastness of Tubi’s library of free movies online, which includes everything from well-known classics and box-office hits to cult movies that sometimes are unavailable to stream anywhere else. <a class="link"   href="https://tubitv.com/home" >Tubi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> provides an unprecedented opportunity for independent filmmakers to share their work, which means you can find a variety of micro-budget movies that otherwise might never be seen. Tubi has also branched out into original productions, although the quality of those films vary.</p><p> Since selections on free movie streaming sites change frequently, it’s helpful that Tubi has dedicated sections both for movies that are newly added and movies that are leaving soon. The sheer volume of content can be a bit overwhelming, but Tubi breaks down selections by genre and into specialty collections that make the experience more manageable. The ad breaks are not excessive, and the countdown to each one makes it less jarring when the movie you’re watching is interrupted.</p><h5 id="Tubi-1"><a href="#Tubi-1" class="headerlink" title="Tubi"></a>Tubi</h5><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Huge selection of movies and TV shows</li><li>Lesser-known films not available anywhere else</li><li>Useful warnings about ad breaks</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Sheer volume of content can be overwhelming</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tubitv.com/" >Watch Tubi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Pluto-TV"><a href="#Pluto-TV" class="headerlink" title="Pluto TV"></a>Pluto TV</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pluto-TV.png"                      alt="Pluto TV logo."                > </p><p><em>Pluto TV</em></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://pluto.tv/" >Pluto TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a pioneer in the popular free ad-supported TV (FAST) space, offering up a range of linear-style channels. That means you don’t have to scroll through a library of titles if you just want to sit back and watch TV. Put on a channel devoted to a movie genre like drama or horror, or a niche interest like Godzilla movies or Hallmark, and Pluto will offer up an endless supply of programming. There are on-demand options, too, and if something on a FAST channel catches your interest, you can pause or start from the beginning.</p><p> Thanks to Pluto’s Paramount Global corporate ownership, there’s often premium content from Paramount Pictures, Paramount+, CBS, and Showtime cycling through the service’s offerings, along with news from local CBS affiliates. The on-demand library is a little tougher to navigate than the live channels, and Pluto’s interface always has some video auto-playing, which means you can change or mute the channel, but you can’t turn it off while you browse.</p><h5 id="Pluto-TV-1"><a href="#Pluto-TV-1" class="headerlink" title="Pluto TV"></a>Pluto TV</h5><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Wide selection of live channels</li><li>Content from Paramount Global brands</li><li>Large on-demand library</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Constant auto-play video</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://pluto.tv/" >Watch Pluto TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Freevee"><a href="#Freevee" class="headerlink" title="Freevee"></a>Freevee</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/freevee_logo.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Freevee logo"                > </p><p><em>Amazon Freevee</em></p><p> Previously known as IMDb TV, <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/storefront?contentType=subscription&contentId=freewithads&benefitId=freewithads&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904601&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/the-best-free-movie-websites-that-are-legal-and-safe/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >Freevee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is Amazon’s home for watching free movies online. That means it’s fully integrated into Amazon Prime Video, so if you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber searching for something to watch, you’ll find Freevee offerings alongside Prime Video’s library. That can be convenient because it expands the selection of what’s available, but it can also be frustrating when <a class="link"   href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-leading-ios-emulators-virtual-ps2-world/" >Prime Video users <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> click on a movie or show only to discover that it features ad breaks.</p><p> For users who aren’t Amazon Prime subscribers, though, Freevee offers a convenient way to watch free movies, including some Prime Video original programming that’s offered through Freevee on a limited basis. Freevee has also delved into original programming with movies like the romantic comedy <em>Love Accidentally</em> and series like crime drama <em>Bosch: Legacy</em> and Emmy-nominated reality&#x2F;scripted hybrid comedy <em>Jury Duty</em>. With the resources of Amazon behind it, Freevee has become one of the most prominent free movie websites.</p><h5 id="Amazon-Freevee"><a href="#Amazon-Freevee" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Freevee"></a>Amazon Freevee</h5><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Integration with Amazon Prime Video</li><li>Large selection of content</li><li>Original programming including popular titles</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Can be confusing to distinguish from Prime Video selections</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/storefront?contentType=subscription&contentId=freewithads&benefitId=freewithads&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904601&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/the-best-free-movie-websites-that-are-legal-and-safe/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >Watch Freevee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Hoopla"><a href="#Hoopla" class="headerlink" title="Hoopla"></a>Hoopla</h2><p><img src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Hoopla.png" alt="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Hoopla.png"> </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123472/16836" target="_top" id="2123472">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123472" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123472/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>Hoopla</em></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.hoopladigital.com/" >Hoopla <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of two major free movie websites available to anyone with a library card from many libraries across the country. Depending on the individual library’s policies, cardholders can stream a limited number of free movies online every month, without subscription fees or ads. Hoopla’s film library includes an assortment of classics as well as many of the same fare available on free ad-supported streaming sites. It can sometimes be tough to find new releases, but Hoopla often carries movies that have just been released for VOD rental and aren’t available on any other ad-supported or subscription-based streaming services yet.</p><p> Hoopla’s borrowing limits also apply to its other available formats, including e-books, graphic novels, music, and audiobooks, so it can be tricky for dedicated library patrons to balance those different types of media. Hoopla sometimes offers “bonus borrows” of content that doesn’t count toward monthly limits, and it also offers BingePass, with unlimited access to similar content like Hallmark programming or Curiosity Stream documentaries for a set period of time.</p><h5 id="Hoopla-1"><a href="#Hoopla-1" class="headerlink" title="Hoopla"></a>Hoopla</h5><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Completely free with no ads</li><li>Selection of movies including exclusive new releases</li><li>Available to anyone with a library card</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Limited number of streams per month</li><li>Movies and TV counted along with other media borrows</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.hoopladigital.com/" >Watch Hoopla <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Kanopy"><a href="#Kanopy" class="headerlink" title="Kanopy"></a>Kanopy</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kanopy.jpg"                      alt="Kanopy"                > </p><p>Kanopy</p><p> Like Hoopla, <a class="link"   href="https://www.kanopy.com/" >Kanopy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a way to watch free movies online for patrons of many libraries, as well as for university students. While there’s plenty of overlap between selections on both Hoopla and Kanopy, Kanopy is more focused on foreign films, documentaries, and arthouse releases. Like Hoopla, Kanopy offers a limited number of free movies online depending on the individual institution that provides access. Unlike Hoopla, Kanopy is entirely devoted to movies and TV, so users don’t have to split their credits among different types of media.</p><p> Selections on Kanopy may differ depending on licensing agreements for each sponsoring institution, so not every movie is available for every user. In general, Kanopy features a wide range of vintage and modern films, including movies from popular indie distributors like A24, which signed a long-term deal to provide content to Kanopy. That gives Kanopy a more diverse lineup of films than many subscription streaming services.</p><h5 id="Kanopy-1"><a href="#Kanopy-1" class="headerlink" title="Kanopy"></a>Kanopy</h5><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Completely free with no ads</li><li>Available to anyone with a library card</li><li>Impressive selection of arthouse and foreign films</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Limited number of streams per month</li><li>Selections differ depending on the sponsoring institution</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.kanopy.com/" >Watch Kanopy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137225/26400" target="_top" id="2137225">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137225" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137225/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Roku-Channel"><a href="#The-Roku-Channel" class="headerlink" title="The Roku Channel"></a>The Roku Channel</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/roku-channel.png"                      alt="roku-channel"                > </p><p><em>Roku</em></p><p> No, you don’t need to own a Roku device in order to watch the <a class="link"   href="https://therokuchannel.roku.com/" >Roku Channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. That common misconception may have kept some people away from one of the most reliable free movie websites. While the Roku Channel is integrated into Roku streaming devices and Roku TVs, it’s also available as a standalone app on other streaming devices and as a website, where it features a selection of free ad-supported movies.</p><p> The Roku Channel also offers more than 350 live FAST channels, from cable brands like Ion and Court TV and franchises like <em>The Walking Dead</em> and <em>Power Rangers</em>. The Roku Channel has also delved into original programming, picking up all the shows from short-lived streaming service Quibi and producing original movies like <em>Weird: The Al Yankovic Story</em>. Ad breaks are relatively unobtrusive and usually cluster toward the first two-thirds or so of a movie, so the most involving part can run uninterrupted.</p><h5 id="The-Roku-Channel-1"><a href="#The-Roku-Channel-1" class="headerlink" title="The Roku Channel"></a>The Roku Channel</h5><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Available without a Roku device</li><li>Hundreds of live channels</li><li>Popular original programming</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Roku integration limits usefulness elsewhere</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://therokuchannel.roku.com/" >Watch The Roku Channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Crackle"><a href="#Crackle" class="headerlink" title="Crackle"></a>Crackle</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crackle.png"                      alt="Crackle"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977004">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977004.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977004">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977004.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977004%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977004/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><em>Crackle</em></p><p> Initially launched in 2004, <a class="link"   href="https://www.crackle.com/" >Crackle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the oldest free movie streaming sites, and it’s undergone various changes in ownership and content over the years. One thing that’s remained consistent is its position as a go-to site to watch free movies online, and its current ownership under Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment gives it access to a shared library of content with corporate sibling Redbox. You can find many of the same movies on both sites, with a range of genres, from classics to modern blockbusters, along with TV series including anime and British imports.</p><p> Crackle also hosts original content, including numerous romance and action movies, and TV shows like <em>Chosen</em> starring Milo Ventimiglia and the series adaptation of Guy Ritchie’s <em>Snatch</em>. Although its original productions aren’t as elaborate as they’ve been in the past, it’s still a reliable destination for on-demand ad-supported movies, just as it’s been for nearly two decades.</p><h5 id="Crackle-1"><a href="#Crackle-1" class="headerlink" title="Crackle"></a>Crackle</h5><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Longtime destination for free content</li><li>Robust library of movies and TV series</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Scaled back original content</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.crackle.com/" >Watch Crackle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Vudu"><a href="#Vudu" class="headerlink" title="Vudu"></a>Vudu</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/vudu-free.png"                      alt="Free movies at Vudu"                > </p><p><em>Vudu</em></p><p> Although <a class="link"   href="https://www.vudu.com/" >Vudu <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is mainly known as an outlet for digital purchases and rentals, it’s also a destination for watching free movies online. Vudu’s selections include certain movies that are available to stream for free with ads, alongside movies for rental or purchase. That can make things a bit confusing, especially when a movie’s page lists both a rental price and a free option, but if you know what you are looking for, you can find plenty of options to watch free movies on Vudu.</p><p> There’s a dedicated section on Vudu’s site for free movies, so users don’t have to sort through paid content in order to find something to watch for free. Vudu’s free selections include movies and TV series in a variety of genres. Browsing through genres pulls up both free and paid offerings, so users can find something to watch for free as an alternative to a rental or purchase. It provides a good balance as long as you pay attention to how each selection is labeled.</p><h5 id="Vudu-1"><a href="#Vudu-1" class="headerlink" title="Vudu"></a>Vudu</h5><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Free content integrated with rentals and purcahses</li><li>Dedicated section for free offerings</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Can be difficult to differentiate free and paid selections</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.vudu.com/" >Watch Vudu <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Redbox"><a href="#Redbox" class="headerlink" title="Redbox"></a>Redbox</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/redbox-free.png"                      alt="Free movies at Redbox"                > </p><p><em>Redbox</em></p><p> People may be more familiar with <a class="link"   href="https://www.redbox.com/" >Redbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for its physical kiosks outside places like grocery stores and drugstores, which offer DVDs for rent, but the Redbox website is a destination for digital purchases and rentals as well as a place to watch free movies online. There’s a much wider selection of movies at Redbox online than at the kiosk, although info about movies available for physical rental comes up in search results alongside digital availability. That’s handy for finding all options to see a particular movie you want to watch, including the option to watch for free with ads.</p><p> You can also browse only the free selections, although they’re a little buried on the site’s home page. In addition to on-demand selections, Redbox also features FAST channels for a variety of movie genres and TV series, as well as news, music videos, and more. It’s not as extensive as the FAST selections on some other sites, but it offers a decent sampling of what Redbox has to offer.</p><h5 id="Redbox-1"><a href="#Redbox-1" class="headerlink" title="Redbox"></a>Redbox</h5><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Wider selection of movies than Redbox kiosks</li><li>Extensive lineup of live channels</li><li>Free offerings integrated with paid rentals</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Free section is somewhat difficult to navigate</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.redbox.com/" >Watch Redbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Plex"><a href="#Plex" class="headerlink" title="Plex"></a>Plex</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/52676193158_f5aa90d373_o.jpg"                      alt="Plex app icon on an Apple TV"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115916/19272" target="_top" id="2115916">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115916" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115916/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Justin Duino &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU904601/https://www.plex.tv/" >Plex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is so much more than just a place to watch free movies online, although it has plenty of free options available if that’s what you’re looking for. It’s designed as a one-stop destination for all your movie-watching needs, so you can organize your personal collection of digital movies or build watch lists for various subscription streaming services like Netflix and Hulu. Alongside those functions, Plex also includes plenty of movies to watch free with ads, which can be integrated with the rest of your movie library.</p><p> If you’d rather not sign up for an account, you can still easily just stream movies and TV shows for free with ads, and Plex features a similar range of selections as other sites that focus solely on free offerings, with more than 20,000 titles available.

It’s home to FAST channels for cult favorites like <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> and <em>ALF</em>, as well as on-demand episodes of those and other offbeat TV series. The movie selection is heavy on horror, martial arts, sci-fi, and other cult genres. While Shout may not offer the breadth of other free movie websites, it’s more expertly curated.</p><p> One thing available on Shout that even most subscription streaming services don’t offer is commentary tracks, which are now mostly found only on DVD and Blu-ray releases. If you want to hear director John Carpenter talk about his horror anthology <em>Body Bags</em>, director Larry Cohen talk about cult monster movie <em>Q: The Winged Serpent</em>, or other filmmakers and actors comment on their work, then Shout is the free movie website to check out.</p><h5 id="Shout-Factory-TV"><a href="#Shout-Factory-TV" class="headerlink" title="Shout Factory TV"></a>Shout Factory TV</h5><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Curated focus on cult and genre fare</li><li>Commentary tracks</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Smaller selection than other services</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://shout-tv.com/" >Watch Shout TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="YouTube"><a href="#YouTube" class="headerlink" title="YouTube"></a>YouTube</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/52861698307_35784b1ef8_o.jpg"                      alt="YouTube app in an app folder"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2135472">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2135472">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2135472%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135472/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Jason Montoya &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> Everyone knows <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as the top place for video content online, with literally hundreds of millions of user-uploaded videos of every type. But YouTube also functions as a free movie streaming site, with an official selection of movies available to watch with ads. Given YouTube’s sometimes chaotic free-for-all of content, it may be tough to find a particular movie to stream for free. It’s possible to browse a list of YouTube’s free movies online, but that listing isn’t easy to locate from YouTube’s home page.</p><p> YouTube’s official free offerings are far from the only free movies available on the site, though, and there are dozens of legal YouTube channels that offer free movies, from public-domain selections to small independent films looking to find an audience. If you can wade through the reams of content and wrangle your way through YouTube’s algorithm, it’s possible to find plenty of hidden gems along with the more popular free selections.</p><h5 id="YouTube-1"><a href="#YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="YouTube"></a>YouTube</h5><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Free mainstream movies with ads</li><li>Public domain and indie films uploaded by users</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Volume of non-movie content makes curation difficult</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/" >Watch YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-clarity-unleashed-in-depth-review-of-the-hp-z32-x-display/"><u>[New] Clarity Unleashed In-Depth Review of the HP Z32 X Display</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-igtv-to-fb-broadcast-optimal-sharing-strategies/"><u>[New] In 2024, IGTV to FB Broadcast Optimal Sharing Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-the-art-of-instagram-video-craftsmanship/"><u>[New] The Art of Instagram Video Craftsmanship</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/discover-how-to-watch-live-tv-for-free-the-best-apps-for-amazon-firestick-users/"><u>Discover How to Watch Live TV for Free: The Best Apps for Amazon Firestick Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/dish-network-announces-second-price-hike-what-you-need-to-know/"><u>Dish Network Announces Second Price Hike: What You Need To Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/dont-miss-out-get-your-plex-lifetime-subscription-at-a-20-discount-immediately/"><u>Don't Miss Out!

We’ll show you how to do that on your iPhone, Android phone, and desktop computer.</p><h2 id="Use-YouTube’s-Mobile-Website-to-Disable-Shorts"><a href="#Use-YouTube’s-Mobile-Website-to-Disable-Shorts" class="headerlink" title="Use YouTube’s Mobile Website to Disable Shorts"></a>Use YouTube’s Mobile Website to Disable Shorts</h2><p> A convenient way to get rid of the Shorts from your feed is by using YouTube’s mobile site on your phone. On the site, you have the option to hide the “Shorts” section for 30 days, something you can’t do in the platform’s mobile app (at the time of writing).</p><p> To do that, launch your preferred web browser on your phone (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, or any other browser) and open <a class="link"   href="https://m.youtube.com/" >m.youtube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On the site, sign in to your Google account.</p><p> After signing in, access the “Shorts” section. Here, in the section’s top-right corner, tap “X.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1-youtube-mobile-site-disable-shorts.png"                      alt="Select &quot;X&quot; in the top-right corner."                > </p><p> As soon as you tap “X,” YouTube will hide the “Shorts” section and say that the shelf will be hidden for 30 days.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2-youtube-mobile-site-shorts-hidden.png"                      alt="Shorts hidden on YouTube&#39;s mobile site."                > </p><p> And that’s it. When you start seeing those Shorts again, tap “X” again, and the section will be hidden for another 30 days.</p><h2 id="Turn-Off-Shorts-in-YouTube’s-Mobile-App"><a href="#Turn-Off-Shorts-in-YouTube’s-Mobile-App" class="headerlink" title="Turn Off Shorts in YouTube’s Mobile App"></a>Turn Off Shorts in YouTube’s Mobile App</h2><p> YouTube’s app for iPhone and Android doesn’t offer the option to remove Shorts, but you can mark your Shorts as “Not Interested” to <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-driving-income-through-youtube-shorts-crucial-elements-and-earnings-potential-for-2024/" >remove them from your feed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> temporarily. Unlike the method above, there’s no guarantee that your Shorts will be hidden for any number of days.</p><p> To use this method, launch YouTube on your phone and access the “Shorts” section.

Once you’ve done that, you’ll start to see them less and YouTube will temporarily hide the “Shorts” section from your feed. And that’s it.</p><p> If you start seeing Shorts again, simply mark them as “Not Interested” again to get rid of them.</p><h2 id="Use-an-Old-Version-of-the-YouTube-App-on-Your-Phone"><a href="#Use-an-Old-Version-of-the-YouTube-App-on-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Use an Old Version of the YouTube App on Your Phone"></a>Use an Old Version of the YouTube App on Your Phone</h2><p> If you must use the YouTube app, but you can’t live with the Shorts in it, one option you have is to downgrade your app version when Shorts didn’t exist. You basically get a YouTube app version for when the company hadn’t rolled out the Shorts feature.</p><p> On an iPhone, <a class="link"   href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-a-practical-guide-to-using-vsco-for-professionals/" >installing an old version of an app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is extremely difficult, if not impossible. Therefore, we recommend you stick to the other methods outlined in this guide. However, if you want to give it a try, we have a guide on how to install an old version of an app on an iPhone. Check that out and see if you can get an old version of the YouTube app.</p><p> On Android, while you can install older versions of apps by simply <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-unlock-premium-quality-streaming-on-the-worlds-largest-network/" >loading those apps’ APK files <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, that doesn’t work too well with Google’s stock apps (which includes YouTube). However, if your phone came with YouTube version 14.12.56 or earlier, you can uninstall the app’s updates to bring the app to that specific version, eliminating any Shorts from your YouTube feed.</p><p> To do that on your Android phone, navigate to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; YouTube. In the top-right corner, tap the three dots and choose “Uninstall Updates.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/4-uninstall-youtube-app-updates-android.png"                      alt="Tap &quot;Uninstall Updates.&quot;"                > </p><p> Select “OK” in the prompt.</p><p> When you’ve downgraded your app, launch the app, and you won’t see the “Shorts” section. You’ll want to <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/cing-video-success-top-8-yt-thumbnail-strategies-for-2024/" >keep your app from being updated automatically <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> so that your phone doesn’t bring it to the latest version, which will start showing Shorts again.</p><h2 id="Remove-Shorts-From-YouTube’s-Desktop-Site"><a href="#Remove-Shorts-From-YouTube’s-Desktop-Site" class="headerlink" title="Remove Shorts From YouTube’s Desktop Site"></a>Remove Shorts From YouTube’s Desktop Site</h2><p> If you’re a desktop user, getting rid of Shorts from <a class="link"   href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-ultimate-arena-crafting-the-quintessential-7-total-war-tactics/" >YouTube’s computer site <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is as easy as selecting an option. You click an option that hides the Shorts for 30 days, and when that time period is over, you click the option again to remove Shorts for another 30 days, and so on.</p><p> To do that, launch your desktop web browser and open <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Consumers-Alerted-as-Dish-TV-Implements-Another-Increase-in-Subscription-Fees"><a href="#Consumers-Alerted-as-Dish-TV-Implements-Another-Increase-in-Subscription-Fees" class="headerlink" title="Consumers Alerted as Dish TV Implements Another Increase in Subscription Fees"></a>Consumers Alerted as Dish TV Implements Another Increase in Subscription Fees</h2><p>DISH is raising the prices of its satellite TV across the board. This price hike comes almost a year after the $5 monthly price increase in 2023. Starting from next month, the monthly bill will cost up to $8 more, according to Dish.</p><p> The satellite television company issued a notice to its customers that it’s raising the prices of “select local, core programming, fees and surcharges.” The price change will go into effect from September 19, 2024. These fees and surcharges include a DVR fee (at $15 a month), DISH Protect (at $30 a month for six months) and a broadcast TV fee (at $12 a month).</p><p> Excluding those surcharges and fees, here is how much each package will now cost:</p><ul><li>Smart Pack for $65.</li><li>Flex Pack for $67.99.</li><li>DISH America for $82.99.</li><li>America’s Top 120 for $97.99.</li><li>America’s Top 120+ for $102.99.</li><li>America’s Top 200 for $112.99.</li><li>America’s Top 250 for $122.99.</li><li>America’s Everything for $147.99.</li></ul><p> To give you context, America’s Top 120 pack costs $84.99 right now, which makes for a $13 hike. The cheapest $60.99 Smart Pack is now $5 extra. Clarifying the reason behind the price change, DISH claims broadcasters are twisting its arms to raise prices. “The local broadcasters of ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC stations continually force us to pay more for their channels or threaten to remove them from our customers. The cost for these channels has risen over 200% over the past 5 years,” the notification reads.</p><p> Also, DISH explained that you have to subscribe to all the channels that one company owns. “There are just a couple of large programmers that own most of the channels you enjoy. You may only watch a few channels, but these large conglomerates require you to subscribe to all their channels,” the notification continues.</p><p> Source: <a class="link"   href="https://my.dish.com/infocenter" >Dish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-stream-success-linking-twitch-feeds-to-fb-networks/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Stream Success Linking Twitch Feeds to FB Networks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-mc-community-living-best-residential-blueprints-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] MC Community Living Best Residential Blueprints for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-sonys-masterpiece-in-motion-graphics-xperia-xz-premium-unboxed/"><u>2024 Approved Sony's Masterpiece in Motion Graphics Xperia XZ Premium Unboxed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/become-a-pro-editor-in-seconds-canvas-essential-secrets/"><u>Become a Pro Editor in Seconds Canva's Essential Secrets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/fractured-fortify-forge-on-postpone-potential-upgrade/"><u>Fractured Fortify: Forge On, Postpone Potential Upgrade</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-frp-on-itel-p40-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Bypass FRP on Itel P40?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-navigating-zoomed-in-shots-avoiding-common-pitfalls-with-videoleap/"><u>In 2024, Navigating Zoomed-In Shots Avoiding Common Pitfalls with VideoLeap</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-let-us-talk-about-the-famous-photoshop-and-most-commonly-used-glitch-effect-the-article-understudy-will-discuss-in-detail-about-photo-glit/"><u>New 2024 Approved Let Us Talk About the Famous Photoshop and Most Commonly Used Glitch Effect.

Spotify showcases this with its wildly popular year-end “Wrapped” recap, but there’s so much more you can get your hands on. Stats.fm is an app that allows you to dig deeper into your music listening habits and do some truly awesome stuff with it.</p><h2 id="What-Does-Stats-fm-Do"><a href="#What-Does-Stats-fm-Do" class="headerlink" title="What Does Stats.fm Do?"></a>What Does Stats.fm Do?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://stats.fm/" >Stats.fm <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an app that ties into your Spotify account and gives you a wealth of information and tools that, simply put, Spotify would never dream of doing. As the name implies, stats are a big part of the experience, but that’s not actually why I’ve kept using it for so long.</p><p> We’ll start with the stats, though. Spotify shows your top artists and tracks for the month, but that’s barely scratching the surface, especially if you listen to a lot of music. Stats.fm is available for <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/spotistats-for-spotify/id1526912392" >iPhone, iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2005030/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.netlob.spotistats" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it can show your:</p><ul><li>Top tracks</li><li>Top artists</li><li>Top albums</li><li>Top genres</li><li>Most common time of day you listen to music</li><li>Number of tracks streamed</li><li>Number of minutes streamed</li></ul><p>Close </p><p> Here’s where it gets even better: All of these stats can be viewed by the last four weeks, six months, lifetime, and custom date range. All of this information enables you to do things like see which genres you prefer at certain times of the day, see which songs you were listening to on a specific date, rank your top albums for the summer, and so much more.</p><p> There’s a lot more to Stats.fm than I’m touching in this article. For example, Stats.fm is also a social network of sorts, connecting people with similar music tastes. You can see how you rank as a listener for your favorite artists. It can also generate monthly Wrapped-style recap images that are perfect for sharing with friends.</p><h2 id="Why-It’s-On-My-Phone"><a href="#Why-It’s-On-My-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Why It’s On My Phone"></a>Why It’s On My Phone</h2><p> I mentioned that Stats.fm does more than just show stats, and that’s ultimately why it’s on my phone. The features I use the most are all about playlists. I love making my own playlists, and Stats.fm makes it easy to do some cool stuff with them.</p><p> After each season comes to an end—Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall—I like to make a playlist of my top songs. First, I use the top tracks and custom date range filter. Then, I simply tap the playlist icon in the top right corner, limit the length to 100 songs, and select “Create Playlist.” Now I can open Spotify, find the newly created playlist, and rename it to “Summer 2024.” This is an easy way to make musical time capsules.</p><p>Close </p><p> The next feature is even more fun. When you create a playlist from Stats.fm, you have the option to enable “Playlist Sync.” This allows Stats.fm to dynamically adjust the playlist when your top tracks change. I’ve used this feature to create my own personal “<a class="link"   href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/" >Billboard Hot 100 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.”</p><p> All I had to do was create a playlist of my top 100 tracks and select “7 days” as the sync period. This means every night, Stats.fm looks back at my last 7 days of listening history and puts the top 100 songs in the playlist. No matter when I listen to the playlist, it’s always an up-to-date list of my current “Hot 100” songs. I think that’s pretty cool.</p><p>Close </p><p> Long story short, Stats.fm allows me to do some interesting things with my Spotify data. The Wrapped recap at the end of the year is nice, but I don’t want to wait a full year to see my listening stats. All of this data is available in Spotify, so you might as well do something with it.</p><p><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/i-finally-paid-for-the-paprika-app-and-i-regret-not-doing-it-sooner/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/why-is-this-app-paprika.jpg"                      alt="Paprika app on the Android home screen."                ></a> Related </p><h5 id="I-Finally-Paid-for-the-Paprika-App-and-I-Regret-Not-Doing-It-Sooner"><a href="#I-Finally-Paid-for-the-Paprika-App-and-I-Regret-Not-Doing-It-Sooner" class="headerlink" title="I Finally Paid for the Paprika App, and I Regret Not Doing It Sooner"></a><a class="link"   href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/exploring-high-dynamic-range-potentials-via-luminance-for-2024/" >I Finally Paid for the Paprika App, and I Regret Not Doing It Sooner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h5><p>Why did I wait so long?</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-sim-card-on-poco-c51-online-without-jailbreak-by-drfone-android/" >2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-snappy-solutions-maintaining-a-vigorous-snapstreak/"><u>[Updated] Snappy Solutions Maintaining a Vigorous Snapstreak</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/essential-technology-gadgets-all-students-must-have-for-academic-success/"><u>Essential Technology Gadgets All Students Must Have for Academic Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/in-2024-iphone-nightscape-techniques-unlocked/"><u>In 2024, IPhone Nightscape Techniques Unlocked</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-simple-and-effective-ways-to-change-your-country-on-youtube-app-of-your-apple-iphone-12-mini-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Simple and Effective Ways to Change Your Country on YouTube App Of your Apple iPhone 12 mini | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/today-we-will-take-a-look-at-the-best-motion-tracking-video-editing-apps-for-ios-and-android-devices-for-2024/"><u>Today We Will Take a Look at the Best Motion Tracking Video Editing Apps for iOS & Android Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/ultimate-viewing-tips-accessing-elite-competitive-swimming-at-the-olympics/"><u>Ultimate Viewing Tips: Accessing Elite Competitive Swimming at the Olympics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/understanding-youtubes-high-quality-streaming-exploring-the-enhanced-bitrate/"><u>Understanding YouTube's High-Quality Streaming: Exploring the Enhanced Bitrate</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/unveiling-kodi-update-2e3-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-new-features-and-enhancements/"><u>Unveiling Kodi Update 2E.3 – A Comprehensive Guide to the New Features and Enhancements</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977032">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977032">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977032%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977032/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Critical-Demand-for-Advanced-Cropping-Features-on-Video-Streaming-Services"><a href="#The-Critical-Demand-for-Advanced-Cropping-Features-on-Video-Streaming-Services" class="headerlink" title="The Critical Demand for Advanced Cropping Features on Video Streaming Services"></a>The Critical Demand for Advanced Cropping Features on Video Streaming Services</h2><h3 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>TV shows and movies with non-standard aspect ratios cause annoying black bars on streaming services.</li><li>Most streaming apps lack the ability to crop or zoom images to minimize black bars for a better viewing experience.</li><li>Lack of cropping tools on streaming apps creates issues for viewers watching content with non-standard aspect ratios, unlike older media players.</li></ul><p> Streaming services are great, but they have their disadvantages compared to offline and physical media. We all know the obvious ones, but have you considered that you don’t get to crop services like Netflix the way you want, when you want?</p><h2 id="The-Aspect-Ratio-Mismatch"><a href="#The-Aspect-Ratio-Mismatch" class="headerlink" title="The Aspect Ratio Mismatch"></a>The Aspect Ratio Mismatch</h2><p> Your TV almost certainly has a standard widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9, but older content from before this became the standard conforms to 4:3, which is what most TVs were in the CRT era. Additionally, many movies use an aspect ratio close to 21:9, which in modern parlance is known as “Ultrawide” but has been called “anamorphic”, “Panavision”, “Cinemascope”, and probably a few more I’m unaware of. This is what movies meant for the cinema, such as the modern <em>Dune</em> adaptation, are usually shot in. There are also, inexplicably, shows and movies meant for TV that nonetheless have a ever-so-slightly wider aspect ratio than 16:9, resulting in tiny black bars at the top and bottom of the picture.</p><p> Those black bars or pillars will appear on your 16:9 TV whenever you watch anything that isn’t 16:9 exactly, and for some people this can be quite annoying. If you use a Blu Ray or DVD player, you have the option to crop or stretch the image to fit the entire screen. Likewise, most good media player apps (e.g. VLC player) offer comprehensive controls that let you crop and stretch an image to fill the whole screen, or perhaps just a little more of the screen.</p><p> While cinematic purists may balk at this idea, in many films and shows, the parts of the frame that are lost by “punching in” like this may not make much of a difference, and even if it’s not the most artistically pure way to watch the content, the principle that you should have the choice certainly means something.</p><h2 id="Streaming-Apps-Rarely-Have-Cropping-Features"><a href="#Streaming-Apps-Rarely-Have-Cropping-Features" class="headerlink" title="Streaming Apps Rarely Have Cropping Features"></a>Streaming Apps Rarely Have Cropping Features</h2><p> Sadly, streaming apps rarely have tools built in to let you crop or zoom the image if you don’t like having black bars. At least not mainstream paid apps like Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. When you stream your own content with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://network-issues.techidaily.com/instantly-eradicate-playback-problems/" >Plex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you do have the option to flip between different aspect ratios.</p><p> There are also clever methods of stretching video that don’t distort the picture quite so much, such as nonlinear video stretching, where the image is more stretched to the edges of the frame and less to the middle, so you don’t really notice it and characters and objects in the center of the frame still appear normal. Either way, there are lots of viable and valid reasons to have these options in these apps.</p><h2 id="Native-Aspect-Ratio-vs-Containers"><a href="#Native-Aspect-Ratio-vs-Containers" class="headerlink" title="Native Aspect Ratio vs Containers"></a>Native Aspect Ratio vs Containers</h2><p> While I would personally not usually stretch or crop movies and shows to fit the screen, the whole reason I’m disappointed this isn’t possible in these apps has to do with video formatting. You see, I watch a lot (even most) of my movies and shows on my iPad Pro. This device has a native aspect ratio of 4:3, which means I absolutely love watching older content on its gorgeous mini LED screen.</p><p> Cue up some episodes of <em><a class="link"   href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/summit-of-virtual-reality-resolution-for-2024/" >Star Trek <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>: The Next Generation</em> and you’re in for a good time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/star-trek-tng.jpeg"                      alt="An iPad playing an episode of Star Trek The Next Generation"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975555">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975555.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975555">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975555.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975555%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975555/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Sydney Louw Butler &#x2F; How-To Geek &#x2F; Paramount</p><p> However, on some streaming services (I’m looking at you <a class="link"   href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-resolve-samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-screen-not-working-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/" >Crunchyroll <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) 4:3 content seems to be encoded in a 16:9 container. In other words, the black bars are built into the video! Consequently, on my iPad I get both black bars <em>and</em> black pillars!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gundam.jpeg"                      alt="Gundam shown on an iPad with double black bars."                > </p><p>Sydney Louw Butler &#x2F; How-To Geek &#x2F; Bandai Namco</p><p> If the app had any sort of native cropping tool, I could solve this issue with the tap of a button, but sadly it does not.</p><p> Despite usually offering native 4:3 content, Netflix isn’t totally off the hook. Consider the infamous <em>Seinfeld</em> episodes that were cropped to widescreen natively, making some scenes nonsensical. Netflix could simply have offered the native 4:3 video, and given us the choice of whether seeing <a class="link"   href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/seinfeld-netflix-aspect-ratio-pothole-cropped-1234668934/" >the pothole <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> mattered or not.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993651">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993651.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993651">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993651.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993651%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993651/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Using-Your-TV’s-Native-Tools-to-Adjust-the-Picture"><a href="#Using-Your-TV’s-Native-Tools-to-Adjust-the-Picture" class="headerlink" title="Using Your TV’s Native Tools to Adjust the Picture"></a>Using Your TV’s Native Tools to Adjust the Picture</h2><p> While you can’t restore pre-cropped images, if you want to convert 4:3 or 21:9 content to your 16:9 TV, you may have the option to do it by using built-in options on your screen. Assuming you’re using a device like an Android or Apple TV, you can usually override the aspect ratio by using an option on your TV.</p><p> The main downside of this is that you’ll cut off UI elements or subtitles, but at least for some types of content, this might be a viable workaround. However, we shouldn’t need them. Streaming services should provide these options as the bare minimum of any competent media player interface. Even the cheapest VHS or DVD players back in the day offered crop and zoom controls, and it’s a weird step backwards for 21st century TV apps.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-expert-editions-selecting-high-quality-blu-ray-players-freepaid/"><u>[New] Expert Editions Selecting High-Quality Blu-Ray Players (Free/Paid)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ipad-tech-unveiling-the-secrets-of-time-lapse-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, IPad Tech Unveiling the Secrets of Time-Lapse Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-maximizing-fb-instream-ad-impact-configuration-techniques-and-metrics/"><u>[New] In 2024, Maximizing FB Instream Ad Impact Configuration Techniques and Metrics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-5-breakthrough-ways-to-preserve-precise-moments-in-vr-games/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved 5 Breakthrough Ways to Preserve Precise Moments in VR Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/updated-crafting-winning-marketing-campaigns-based-on-market-research-data/"><u>[Updated] Crafting Winning Marketing Campaigns Based on Market Research Data</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/benq-unveils-stunning-low-delay-4k-resolution-projector-series-for-enhanced-visual-experience/"><u>BenQ Unveils Stunning Low-Delay, 4K Resolution Projector Series for Enhanced Visual Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/channel-loss-across-52-regions-impacts-directv-subscribers/"><u>Channel Loss Across 52 Regions Impacts DirecTV Subscribers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/cutting-edge-tools-the-best-9-gif-recorders-for-animated-windows-content-for-2024/"><u>Cutting-Edge Tools The Best 9 GIF Recorders for Animated Windows Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/determining-the-optimal-brightness-level-for-your-television-screen/"><u>Determining the Optimal Brightness Level for Your Television Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/discover-spotifys-hidden-exclusive-premium-subscription-offer/"><u>Discover Spotify's Hidden Exclusive Premium Subscription Offer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/disneyplus-adds-back-popular-movies-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-restrictions/"><u>Disney+ Adds Back Popular Movies: What You Need to Know About the Restrictions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/enhance-your-streaming-experience-with-our-guide-to-restoring-the-classic-shuffle-play-on-netflix-like-platforms/"><u>Enhance Your Streaming Experience with Our Guide to Restoring the Classic 'Shuffle Play' On Netflix-Like Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/enhanced-youtube-multiview-experience-now-available-for-nfl-sunday-ticket-fans/"><u>Enhanced YouTube MultiView Experience Now Available for NFL Sunday Ticket Fans</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/tactics-for-efficiently-handling-fb-connected-services/"><u>Tactics for Efficiently Handling FB-Connected Services</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/unleash-creativity-exquisite-text-effects-for-adobes-affects-for-2024/"><u>Unleash Creativity Exquisite Text Effects For Adobe's Affects for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Good news! You can revisit the best of the game series relatively easily, and you might not even need to spend any caps to do so.</p><h2 id="The-Fallout-TV-Show-Is-Good"><a href="#The-Fallout-TV-Show-Is-Good" class="headerlink" title="The Fallout TV Show Is Good"></a>The <em>Fallout</em> TV Show Is Good</h2><p> Video game to screenplay adaptations don’t always go well, but the team behind Amazon’s production managed to pull off something special with the first season of <em>Fallout</em>. You can watch the show right now with an <a class="link"   href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/deactivating-your-androids-facebook-feature-easy-instructions-inside/" >Amazon Prime membership <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it’s absolutely worth your time.</p><p><em>Fallout</em> is faithful to the source material, packed with cheeky references, and has all the trappings of a worthwhile watch. With a good foundation of solid acting, a suitably hostile setting, and a cast of interesting new characters, the show feels right at home in the <em>Fallout</em> universe. Everything from the color palette to the occasional echo of haunting ambient music feels worthy of the series.</p><p> But don’t take my word for it, reviews are good across the board. The show has been praised for <a class="link"   href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/apr/17/pushing-buttons-fallout-amazon-show" >feeling like it was made by gamers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, for <a class="link"   href="https://collider.com/fallout-tv-show-karma/" >its clever representation of some of the game’s core systems <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and for staying loyal to Fallout’s <a class="link"   href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-18/fallout-game-prime-video-adaptation-review/103736128" >dark comedic brand of violence and political commentary <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> The show succeeds at being both a worthy entry point into the <em>Fallout</em> brand for newcomers while ticking the boxes that seasoned veterans expect thanks to generous lashings of familiar paraphernalia and references. The show thankfully avoids hitting you over the head with its lore callouts and feels more like a tribute than pandering to fan service.</p><p> Or maybe I’m just biased because I love <em>Fallout</em>. If you also love <em>Fallout</em>, buckle up because the show will almost certainly make you think about donning your PIP Boy and getting eviscerated by Deathclaws all over again.</p><h2 id="Fallout-4-Is-Getting-an-Update"><a href="#Fallout-4-Is-Getting-an-Update" class="headerlink" title="Fallout 4 Is Getting an Update"></a><em>Fallout 4</em> Is Getting an Update</h2><p><em>Fallout 4</em> was released in 2015, making it a nine-year-old game at the time of the show’s debut. Despite its age, <em>Fallout 4</em> is probably the most accessible version of Bethesda’s open-world RPG. It’s the most recent wholly single-player installment, and it’s available with Game Pass (Xbox and PC) or as a standalone title (on everything, including PlayStation 4 and 5).</p><p> Set in The Commonwealth, a region that incorporates what was once the state of Massachusetts and the city of Boston, <em>Fallout 4</em> features a fully voiced player character, new base-building mechanics, improved combat, a robust crafting system, and some of the best visuals and world design the series has seen.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/4s2bXQEbpcrsdCZhUYLHAi/fallout-4-is-getting-free-updates" >Bethesda announced <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> a free next-generation update for <em>Fallout 4</em> that arrives on April 25, 2024. This update features a new Enclave quest and new weapons, skins, and decorations for all platforms. It also brings bug fixes, stability improvements, and enhancement to the game’s modding and community content tools.</p><p> The Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 will finally get native versions of the game, with performance and quality mode toggles that offer up to 4K resolution and 60 frames per second. PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions will get new content and tweaks to make the game run better.</p><p> The PC update will add ultra-widescreen support and plenty of fixes to versions of the game on Steam, the Microsoft Store, and GOG. Bethesda is also adding the game to the Epic Games Store. Lastly, the game will finally get Steam Deck verification for handheld play (<a class="link"   href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-instagrams-most-appreciated-ae-layouts/" >although “Deck Verified” can be a mixed bag <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>).</p><p><em>Fallout 4</em> made some changes to the series that aren’t necessarily to everyone’s tastes, notably to the speech system which makes it a little more difficult to predict what your character will say in conversations. The game also pesters you to build and defend settlements, but you can pretty much ignore this aspect if you’d rather.</p><h2 id="Fallout-76-Has-Come-a-Long-Way"><a href="#Fallout-76-Has-Come-a-Long-Way" class="headerlink" title="Fallout 76 Has Come a Long Way"></a><em>Fallout 76</em> Has Come a Long Way</h2><p><em>Fallout 76</em> was Bethesda’s first attempt at making a multiplayer <em>Fallout</em> experience. When it launched in 2018, the game was rough and the reviews reflected this. Not only were there bugs and crashes in abundance, but the game felt crushingly lonely (even for a <em>Fallout</em> title) due to a stark lack of human non-player characters (NPCs).</p><p> Fortunately, the game improved massively in the years that followed. Bethesda introduced human NPCs and overhauled many of the game’s systems in 2020, and followed it up with numerous transformative updates that introduce new items, locations, quests, and more. There are in-app purchases for in-game currency, but all playable content is free.</p><p> The game takes place in what was once the state of West Virginia, an area of natural beauty and hostile mutations. The game is an online multiplayer affair where you can encounter other players and team up to take on quests together. There’s also a heavy emphasis on base building, resource collection, and the in-game economy.</p><p><em>Fallout 76</em> has come a long way since launch, and though it’s probably the weakest game in the series, it’s still a great way to explore the wastes with your friends. It’s also on Game Pass, so if you have a subscription for the Xbox or PC version then you can try it relatively risk-free.</p><p><em>Fallout 76</em> is available on PlayStation 4 and 5 and was even given away for free to <a class="link"   href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-top-strategies-for-capturing-lol-matches/" >PlayStation Plus subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in January 2023 (so check your library, just in case).</p><h2 id="Fallout-3-and-New-Vegas-Are-Still-Landmark-RPGs"><a href="#Fallout-3-and-New-Vegas-Are-Still-Landmark-RPGs" class="headerlink" title="Fallout 3 and New Vegas Are Still Landmark RPGs"></a><em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>New Vegas</em> Are Still Landmark RPGs</h2><p><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> represents something of a crown jewel in the <em>Fallout</em> series. Developed by Obsidian Entertainment, this follow-up to <em>Fallout 3</em> fixes many of the problems that players had with Bethesda’s previous outing. As the name suggests, the game is set in the Mojave wasteland and features numerous Nevada landmarks including the Las Vegas strip.</p><p><em>New Vegas</em> might have the best main storyline of any <em>Fallout</em> game. The game’s meandering plot line incorporates complex choices that have real (if at times unintended) consequences. It also deftly incorporates RPG mechanics in a more tactful way than its predecessor. Though it was horribly buggy at launch, and at times even today, there’s a huge amount to discover and be engrossed by while traversing <em>New Vegas’</em> sun-scorched wasteland.</p><p><em>Fallout 3</em> marked the first 3D game in the series and the first Bethesda release after the game rights were acquired. Set in the Pacific Northwest, <em>Fallout 3’s</em> dreary wasteland was somewhat groundbreaking at the time. Though the main quest line is a bit boring, there’s plenty of fun to be had and stories to discover.</p><p><em>Fallout 3</em> has arguably not aged as gracefully as <em>New Vegas</em>. Your character isn’t a true blank canvas, there are some glaring plot holes in the main quest, and it’s clear that Bethesda was finding its feet in terms of which direction the series should go after the move to 3D. Even so, the game received massive praise on release and it’s not hard to see why.</p><p> Both titles feature Bethesda’s signature environmental storytelling, rich detailed worlds, scathing satire, iconic soundtracks, and melancholy post-apocalyptic vibes. The games are available on Game Pass for PC and Xbox models from the 360 through to the Series X|S. You can also play on the PlayStation 3.</p><h2 id="Don’t-Forget-the-Original-Fallout-Games-Either"><a href="#Don’t-Forget-the-Original-Fallout-Games-Either" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Forget the Original Fallout Games Either"></a>Don’t Forget the Original <em>Fallout</em> Games Either</h2><p> It feels somewhat sacrilegious to have the original <em>Fallout</em> games that started everything as an aside at the end, but the reality is that the original games are probably the least accessible of the bunch. <em>Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game</em> was the 1997 turn-based RPG that set the stage for an entire series (you might say genre) of game.</p><p> Its follow-up <em>Fallout 2</em> arrived a year later. Developed by Interplay and Black Isle respectively, these games use a top-down trimetric perspective and rendered 3D cutscenes to deliver a tactical tale of survival in the aftermath of a nuclear war. The stories told in these two titles are arguably some of the best in the entire series, and the critical acclaim they received is a testament to their standing in gaming history.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fallout_2.jpg"                      alt="Fallout 2 from Black Isle."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975636">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975636.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975636">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975636.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975636%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975636/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Interplay&#x2F;Bethesda Softworks</p><p> For the time, these games were exceptional. Many still hold them up today as great examples of how traditional pen-and-paper role-playing games can be cleverly ported to an interactive medium. You can complete quests in multiple ways based on your character’s skills and whims, something the 3D titles aspired to but which often felt unsatisfying.</p><p> The old <em>Fallout</em> games can be a little off-putting for their dated (yet charming, and oddly period-appropriate) graphics, steep difficulty, and availability. You can buy <em>Fallout</em> and <em>Fallout 2</em> for Windows on GOG, Steam, and the Epic Games Store. Combat-heavy spin-off <em>Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel</em> is also out there.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123512/26400" target="_top" id="2123512">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123512" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123512/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Please-Stand-By"><a href="#Please-Stand-By" class="headerlink" title="Please Stand By"></a>Please Stand By</h2><p> Jumping back into your favorite (or first) <em>Fallout</em> game is the best way to scratch the itch left behind by Amazon’s excellent series.
