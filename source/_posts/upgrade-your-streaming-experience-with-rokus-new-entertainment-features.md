## Upgrade Your Streaming Experience with Roku's New Entertainment Features!

Can't find anything to watch? Go back to your Roku home screen and start playing the Weekly Trivia game. It'll only give you a few minutes of fun, but it's better than mindlessly scrolling through Netflix.

 Roku now offers a Weekly Trivia game on all of its smart TVs and streaming sticks. The game offers ten multiple-choice trivia questions with a focus on pop culture and entertainment. Topical questions related to upcoming events like the Paris Olympic Games or new movie releases will also be featured in the trivia challenge.

 Interestingly, Roku says that you can play its Weekly Trivia game with family and friends, similar to how you might compare a Wordle score with others. And, if you're a fan of the Roku City screensaver, you'll see plenty of familiar characters within the Weekly Trivia game.

> "Featuring 10 multiple choice questions per game, it’s time to put your entertainment knowledge to the test. And the best part is…you can play with your family and friends to see who the real streaming buff is! Every Tuesday, you’ll discover the latest questions tied to cultural moments, such as the upcoming summer games, movie and TV premieres, holidays and more."

 But _why_ is Roku offering a trivia game? I'm not privy to the company's inner workings, but if I had to guess, it's just a cheap and easy way to encourage brand loyalty. If users have a reason to log in every day or every week, they may choose Roku over rival brands in the future.

 Several non-gaming platforms, from YouTube to LinkedIn, have embraced minigames. It's an [industry-wide trend](https://howto.techidaily.com/what-to-do-if-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-on-realme-10t-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) that was probably inspired by the New York Times. Web-based businesses are struggling right now because of an ailing content-delivery and advertising infrastructure, yet the New York Times continues to bring in in loyal customers through games like Wordle and Connections.

 And, presumably, Roku could use its new game to deliver advertisements or sponsored trivia questions. Roku is [an advertising company](https://advertising.roku.com/), and it's constantly searching for [innovative ways](https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-harmonizing-soundscape-and-unboxing-footage/) to serve ads.

 The Roku Weekly Trivia game is available today on all Roku devices in the United States. You'll find the game on your home screen Menu.
