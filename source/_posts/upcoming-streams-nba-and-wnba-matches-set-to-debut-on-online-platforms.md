## Upcoming Streams: NBA & WNBA Matches Set to Debut on Online Platforms

Basketball is among the most watched sports in the US. Sure, as we write this most of your favorite players are in Paris fighting for gold medals with Team USA, but afterward the NBA will be back. When it's back, you'll now be able to watch it on more places.

 The NBA and WNBA have announced groundbreaking new media agreements with The Walt Disney Company, NBCUniversal, and Amazon, starting from the 2025-26 season and extending through 2035-36\. Thanks to this deal, you'll be able to watch both men and women games throughout more online platforms.

 The NBA App will serve as a central hub, directing fans to all nationally televised games across various platforms. These platforms include ABC/ESPN, NBC/Peacock, and [Prime Video](https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-activation-lock-from-the-apple-iphone-8-plus-without-previous-owner-by-drfone-ios/). The new agreements will dramatically increase the availability of NBA games on both streaming and broadcast television. Fans can expect around 75 regular-season games on broadcast TV each season, a significant increase from the current minimum of 15 games. All national games will also be accessible on popular streaming services like Prime Video, Peacock, and ESPN's upcoming standalone streaming service. The partnerships extend to the WNBA as well, with a significant increase in the number of live game telecasts across broadcast, cable, and streaming platforms.

 With this, the NBA is ensuring that its games can be watched from several different platforms. Whether you will need the NBA Season Pass or WNBA Season Pass to actually watch the games on some or all platforms is unclear. The WNBA press release mentions the Season Pass, but the NBA one doesn't. In the case that it actually still requires the Season Pass, it would actually make NBA games more expensive to watch. You would not only need to pay for the Season Pass, but also for the streaming service you're watching the games on.
