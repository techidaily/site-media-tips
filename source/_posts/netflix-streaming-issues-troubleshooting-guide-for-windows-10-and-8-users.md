## Other Solutions to Fix Netflix Errors

Of course, if you are an avid Netflix user, there are other alternative solutions for you to fix Netflix not working:

**Solution 1:** Download an app which installs those latest versions of DLLs (VCLibs120 and the PlayReadyClient2). Because The Netflix app for Windows 10 requires the new version of VCLibs120 and the PlayReadyClient2 DLLs. These DLL files are previously installed in bulk when installing Netflix app, but it seems that it installed the older versions of VCLibs120 and the PlayReadyClient2\. Therefore, install the latest DLLs may help to solve Netflix App not working on Windows 10.

**Solution 2:** Try another multimedia player. What is the media player you currently using? Some players have their own decoder and will load its own codecs, such as 5KPlayer, maybe the Netflix app itself does not work because it is lacking of codecs to load the video. But with 5KPlayer installed on your windows 10/8, Netflix app can load the players' codec instead and then play the videos successfully. You just have to give it a try. 

As an all-in-one AirPlay streamer with video downloading function, 5KPlayer is surely the best replacement of Netflix to solve Netflix App not working problem for good.
