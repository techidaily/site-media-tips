## Part 1: Steps to upload mixtape on Datpiff

 Posting a mixtape on Datpiff is much simpler years ago. All you had to do is creating an account and starting uploading. But now things have been changed. Datpiff now has paid more attention to release more "exclusive" mixtapes from mainstream artists in order to improve its brand. So now if you want to upload mixtapes on Datpiff as a new user, it will take much time than before.

Step 1 Create an account or sign in

 If you are a new user, you need to create an account at first. If you already have an account, you might already have the "upload permissions" on your account (This depends on how old your account is). If you have Datpiff's account for a long time, you are still able to upload mixtapes to Datpiff despite its changes. So if you are a new user, please keep reading.

Step 2 Go to "My Files"

After creating your account, go to My Account > My Files.

Step 3 Go to the "applications" Tab

There are 3 tabs under "My Files": mixtapes, videos, and application.

 You should click the "application" button to apply for "upload permissions".

![Apply Permissions](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/how-to/upload-mixtape-on-datpiff/datpiff-appilcation.jpg)

Step 4 Complete the application form and wait

 You may be required to fill out a short form letting Datpiff know who you are. This will help Datpiff filter out spam and illegal uploads.

Step 5 Follow up via email every 7-14 days

 Wait for the feedback from Datpiff within a few hours (business days). If you didn't hear from Datpiff within 7-14 days, you can write a professional and friendly email to them to ask for an update about your upload application. Keep in mind that your email should be formal, don't use text-message language such as "U" instead of "You", "Wanna" instead of "Want to", etc.

Step 6 Once approved, go back to "My Files"

Step 7 Start to upload your mixtapes

 Click on "mixtapes" under "My Files", this is where you start the process of uploading mixtape on Datpiff. Fill out all of the information about your mixtape and then proceed to the next screen.

Step 8 Upload your mixtape

 You have to upload your mixtape in MP3 format and with a zip file. Datpiff does not accept mixtapes in any other format but MP3\. Note that each song should be uploaded individually and after it's uploaded, you are able to re-arrange them in the order you like.

Step 9 Preview your mixtape

 You can preview your mixtapes after all the information is filled out and all of your MP3 to make sure that everything looks legit (mixtape info, cover, music, etc..).

Step 10 Submit it

 After all information has been confirmed, click the "Submit" button to upload your mixtape to Datpiff. Your mixtape will be uploaded on the site in minutes.
