**Step 2.** When the network condition is set well, you can turn on AirPlay on both your iPhone/iPad and Apple TV.

 • On iPhone 8 or earlier or iOS 11 or earlier, just swipe up from the bottom edge of any screen to open Control Center to turn on AirPlay.  
 • Go to Settings on your Apple TV to activate AirPlay.
