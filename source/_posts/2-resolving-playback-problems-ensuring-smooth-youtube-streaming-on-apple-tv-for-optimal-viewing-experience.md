As a matter of fact, as of March 3, 2021, YouTube had stopped supporting YouTube app on Apple TV 3rd generation models, which means you can’t open YouTube app on such TV models to directly watch YouTube videos. Luckily, things don’t go so bad, as you can still [watch YouTube on Apple TV](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) from a secondary Apple device (iPhone or iPad) via AirPlay. And here is the step-by-step guide.

**Step 1.** Connect your iPhone/iPad and Apple TV to the same WiFi network.

**Step 2.** When the network condition is set well, you can turn on AirPlay on both your iPhone/iPad and Apple TV.

• If you are using iPhone X or later or iPad with iOS 12/13/14 or iPadOS 13/14, just swipe down from the upper-right corner of the screen to open Control Center to turn on iPhone or iPad AirPlay.  
 • On iPhone 8 or earlier or iOS 11 or earlier, just swipe up from the bottom edge of any screen to open Control Center to turn on AirPlay.  
 • Go to Settings on your Apple TV to activate AirPlay.

**Step 3.** On your iPhone or iPad, choose your Apple TV name from the list and then your iPhone/iPad screen will immediately be mirrored to TV.

**Step 4.** Play videos in your YouTube App and then contents will instantly be displayed on your Apple TV.

BTW, you can also use this way to watch YouTube videos on second-generation Apple TV which doesn’t support YouTube app either.
