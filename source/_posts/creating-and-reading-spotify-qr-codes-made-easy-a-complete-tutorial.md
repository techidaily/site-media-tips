 Spotify codes make it easy to [share your favorite songs](https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-win11s-swift-screening-of-images/) and other items on Spotify. We'll show you how to make and scan these codes on your Windows, Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Android devices.

##  What Is a Spotify Code?

 A Spotify code is a machine-readable code in an image. It's much like [a QR code](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-change-lava-yuva-3-lock-screen-password-by-drfone-android/) that you may already be familiar with. You can't read this code, but the Spotify app on your iPhone, iPad, or Android phone can.

 When a user scans this code with their phone, Spotify takes them directly to that item. No messing around with copy and pasting URLs. You can make these codes for your Spotify songs, albums, artists, playlists, podcasts, and even your profile. Both free and premium users can make these codes.

##  How to Make a Spotify Code

 Spotify codes are generated natively by the app for iPhone, iPad, and Android devices. On the desktop, we'll need to use Spotify's website for generating the codes.

 These instructions can vary slightly depending on your platform and app version.

###  Create a Spotify Code on Computer or Web

 To start making a code for your Spotify item, launch the Spotify app on your Windows or Mac computer. Feel free to use [the web version](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-youtube-rankings-secrets-enhancing-video-visibility/) if you'd like. Find the item for which you want to make a code.

 Click the three dots next to your Spotify item and select Share > Copy Link. If you don't see the option, press and hold down the Alt key on Windows or the Option key on a Mac while hovering over the menu.

![Select Share > Copy Spotify URI for an item on Spotify.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2-get-spotify-uri.png) 

 Now, launch a web browser on your computer and access the [Spotify Codes](https://www.spotifycodes.com/) site. On the site, right-click the "Spotify URI" box and select "Paste." Then, beneath the text field, click "Get Spotify Code."

![Paste the item URI and click "Get Spotify Code" on the Spotify Codes site.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3-get-spotify-code.png) 

 A "Create a Spotify Code" pane will appear. In this pane, you can customize the look of your code with the available options:

* **Background Color:** Use this to select the color for your code.
* **Bar Color:** Select a color for the Spotify bar with this option.
* **Size:** Enter the size for your code in pixels here.
* **Format:** Choose "SVG," "PNG," or "JPEG" file format for your code.

![Customize the code in the "Create a Spotify Code" pane on the Spotify Codes site.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/4-customize-spotify-code.png) 

 The code image you see in the "Create a Spotify Code" pane reflects your changes in real time. If this code looks good to you, then at the bottom of the code, click "Download" to save it.

![Click "Download" beneath the code on the Spotify Codes site.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-download-spotify-code.png) 

 You can now send the downloaded code to anyone, and they can scan it to access your item on Spotify.

###  Create a Spotify Code in Spotify for Mobile

 On an iPhone, iPad, or Android phone, you can use the Spotify app itself to make scannable codes. To begin, open the Spotify app on your phone.

 In the app, find the item for which you want to make a code, then tap the three dots next to the item.

![Tap the three dots next to an item in the Spotify app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/6-three-dots-menu.png) 

 On the menu that opens after tapping the three dots, select "Show Spotify Code." You will see your selected item's artwork at the top. The bar at the bottom of this artwork is the Spotify code that others can scan to find your item.

##  How to Scan a Spotify Code

 To scan a Spotify code, you will need Spotify's app for iPhone, iPad, or Android. You can't scan codes on the web or from a computer.

 To start, launch the Spotify app on your phone. In the app, select "Search" from the bar at the bottom.

![Tap "Search" in the Spotify mobile app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-spotify-search.png) 

 Tap the camera icon in the top corner.

![Tap the camera icon next to the "Search Query" box in the Spotify mobile app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10-spotify-scan.png) 

 To scan a Spotify code with your phone's camera, point your camera at the code. To scan a code that is saved as an image on your phone, tap "Select From Photos" instead.

 Spotify will scan the code and give you access to the code's item. Enjoy!
