### Solve VLC Subtitle Delay on Windows, Mac, iOS, Android & TV

#### ![](https://www.5kplayer.com/vlc/../seoimg/1.png) **How to Sync Subtitles in VLC on Windows PC?**

**Method 1.** When playing a video or movie with VLC media player, you simply use the hotkey to adjust the subtitle delay or forward. If subtitle is ahead of sound, press **G**. If subtitle is behind sound, press **H**.
