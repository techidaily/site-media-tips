### Solve VLC Subtitle Delay on Windows, Mac, iOS, Android & TV

#### ![](https://www.5kplayer.com/vlc/../seoimg/1.png) **How to Sync Subtitles in VLC on Windows PC?**

**Method 1.** When playing a video or movie with VLC media player, you simply use the hotkey to adjust the subtitle delay or forward. If subtitle is ahead of sound, press **G**. If subtitle is behind sound, press **H**. With every key press, it will adjust the subtitle by 50 milliseconds, and you will see the confirmation "Subtitle delay 50ms" or "Subtitle delay -50ms" on the top right corner of the playing screen.

However, this way is suitable only when the dialogue and subtitles come with same frame rate. So, you should try method 2 in other situations.
