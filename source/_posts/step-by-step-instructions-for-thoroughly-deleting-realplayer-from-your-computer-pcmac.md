Notes: If you worried that RealTimes not uninstalled completely on Mac, follow this steps:

1\. Open the app at /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app  
2\. Copy the command \[killall "RealTimes"\] to it and press Enter.  
3\. Copy the command \[rm -r /Applications/RealTimes.app\] to it and press Enter.  
4\. Everything is Okay. 

Just so you know, if it shows "command not found" or "no such file", that means you have delete all RealTimes or RealPlayer in the Application file on your Mac. However, if something indicates it is still somewhere on your Mac, you should track it down wiht Finder and then delete it. 

There you are, this is how you uninstall RealPlayer on both PC and Mac. After it's done, you sure need a RealPlayer alternative right? VLC, KMPlayer, MPC-HC, etc. you can try them all out. But I personally recommend you to give 5KPlayer a try. And it is because: **5KPlayer**, the best free RealPlayer alternative not only embraces all the features of RealPlayer but also provides more! No matter you want a RealPlayer player alternative or [RealPlayer downloader alternative](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/), you can count on 5KPlayer. 

**Video Music Player:** this RealPlayer alternative literally plays everything including MKV, AVI, H.265, H.264, MP4, DivX, MP3, AAC, etc and DVDs of all regions. Better still, you are allowed to use 5KPlayer to play 4K 8K UHD videos as well.   
 **Online Video Downloader:** Like RealPlayer, 5KPlayer also supports download HD/UHD online videos and music from Dailymotion, Facebook, Soundcloud, and 300 more online video hosting sites.  
**AirPlay Transmitter/Receiver:**  Yes, that's right, this RealPlayer alternative also works as a free AirPlay server to be able to AirPlay/mirror videos/music from iPhone, iPad to Mac, PC or from Mac, PC to Apple TV. 

Besides, this RealPlayer also manages your vidoe music library very well and it is also an internet radio player! Care to give it a try? It's your call!
