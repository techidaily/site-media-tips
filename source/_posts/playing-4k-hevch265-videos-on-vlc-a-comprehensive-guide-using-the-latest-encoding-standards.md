## How to Play HEVC/H.265 4K Videos with HEVC Player VLC?

 _Written by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21)_ | Last updated: April 30, 2020 

Inevitably, more and more videos are encoded with HEVC/H.265 codec as this compressing method will halve the video size while keep the same quality. However, this type of media file also requires highly-equipped HEVC/H.265 player to play it successfully. Here, we will introduce **VLC HEVC player** and its best alternative for you to play HEVC/H.265 videos up to 4K smoothly.

VLC media player has HEVC/H.265 support for a very long time, that could be proved by its change log.

**VLC version 2.1.1:** Added HEVC/H.265 decoding support in MKV, MP4 and raw files.  
**VLC version 2.1.2:** Fixed the playback problem of some HEVC samples.  
**VLC version 2.2.0:**  
 Added support for HEVC/H.265 encoding using x265.  
 Added HEVC raw packetizer and demuxer.  
 Added HEVC muxing in MP4 and TS.  
**VLC version 3.0.0:**  
 Added Hardware Decoder to support [HEVC hardware decoding](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) on Windows, using DxVA2 and D3D11, support HEVC hardware decoding using OMX and MediaCodec (Android), improve VAAPI for 10bits, HEVC, direct-rendering support, and support OS X and iOS based on Video Toolbox for H.263, H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, H.265/HEVC, MPEG-4 Part 2, and DV.  
 Fixed HEVC packetization mostly.  
 Improved the HEVC support and support raw H265/HEVC files in Demuxers.  
**VLC version 3.0.1:**  
 Improved Hardware Decoder HEVC 10bit performance with Videotoolbox on macOS.  
 Fixed HEVC decoding with some files on Android/macOS/iOS.  
**VLC version 3.0.2:** Fixed snapshot and filters with HEVC hardware decoding.  
**VLC version 3.0.3:** Fixed VideoToolbox with some invalid HEVC streams.  
**VLC version 3.0.4:**  
 Blacklist some intel GPU when decoding HEVC.  
 Improved support for broken HEVC inside MKV.  
**VLC version 3.0.5:** Fixed decoding of some HEVC streams with macOS hardware decoding.

From the VLC update log, we can see that VLC media player developer has done a lot of changes, improvements and fixes to make H.265/HEVC player VLC much better.

## How to Play HEVC/H.265 Videos with VLC HEVC Media Player?

**Step 1.** Free download H.265 HEVC player VLC, install and launch it on your computer.

**Step 2.** Play your HEVC/H.265 video by dragging and dropping the file to VLC, clicking on Media on the menu bar to choose Open File to open a file, or just right clicking on the H.265/HEVC video to open with VLC HEVC player.

**Step 3.** Now, VLC media player will automatically play the HEVC/H.265 video. 

However, if the HEVC/H.265 video bit rate or resolution is too high, VLC won't play it smoothly but with some lag or mosaic. I have tested MKV videos encoded with HEVC from 3mbps to 400mbps, but only find that HEVC/H.265 player VLC plays 30mbps and lower smoothly.
