To choose the best multi region DVD player, you should not only look the brand and price, but also the multifunction, stability, durability and the convenience it brings to you. Here I list three models of all region DVD players for you to choose and they are produced by the well known DVD player manufacturers – Sony, Samsung and Phillips.
