 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

**Multi region DVD player**, as its name indicates, can play DVDs of all regions without external help to decode the DVD region code. To choose the best multi region DVD player, you should not only look the brand and price, but also the multifunction, stability, durability and the convenience it brings to you. Here I list three models of all region DVD players for you to choose and they are produced by the well known DVD player manufacturers – Sony, Samsung and Phillips.
