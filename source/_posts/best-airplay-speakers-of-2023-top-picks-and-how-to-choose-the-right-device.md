### Top 6 AirPlay Devices You Should Buy 2019

**1\. Apple TV 4th Generation** 

**Price & Models:** $199 for 64GB, $149 for 32GB  
 Introduced in 2015, the 4th generation of this AirPlay device is a product of integration based on its 2006 predecessor: Being the authoritative device developed by Apple, it's the best option to enjoy iOS-like experience from the tvOS Store basketing over 8,000 APPs as of the end of 2015\.   
Gearing into an HDTV, getting through a set of procedures, and this set-top box easily turns your display recognizable for other AirPlay senders. It's always glad to find the developers trying to incorporate state-of-the-art ideas into the latest models: 1080p streaming was realized back in Apple TV 3, followed by major upgrades in Siri (still half-baked when compared to that for iOS), and tvOS.
