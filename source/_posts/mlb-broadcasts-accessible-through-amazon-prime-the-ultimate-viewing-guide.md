##  You can watch MLB games with MLB.TV

 If you want to watch MLB games on Amazon Prime Video, you will need to add the MLB.TV channel to your membership. At $24.99 per month, the add-on is definitely pricier than most other Prime Video channels, but it's still cheaper than other all-access sports extras like [NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube TV](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/complete-manual-for-expert-use-of-screen-recorder-by-zd-soft-for-2024/).

 MLB.TV subscribers can watch out-of-market MLB games that don't have any regional or national restrictions. You will need a Prime Video membership to access the MLB.TV channel on Prime, but once you have that, getting to MLB games is easy.

 Purchase of MLB.TV is only available while the season is happening. The steps below will not work during the offseason.

 To add the MLB.TV channel to Amazon Prime, log into the [Amazon website](https://www.amazon.com/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001788&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fhow-to-watch-mlb-games-on-amazon-prime%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) on a computer or mobile device. From the top right of the screen, choose All > Prime Video > Store.

![Use the Amazon Store to buy MLB.TV.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/amazon-mlb-1.jpg) 

 Search for "MLB.TV" or "MLB TV" at the top of the screen.

##  Out-of-market games vs in-market games

 Out-of-market games are ones that air in regions outside your geographic area. In-market games are those that show your local team. For example, if you live in Michigan, the Detroit Tigers are in-market games, while the Colorado Rockies would be out-of-market.

 For most customers, MLB.TV is designed to watch out-of-market games. However, if an out-of-market game is airing on a national network in your area, it won't be available for live streaming on MLB.TV. MLB on FOX national games, for example.

 A select number of subscribers can also watch in-market games on the app. Local fans of the San Diego Padres and Arizona Diamondbacks can watch live in-market games on MLB.TV as long as there are no national restrictions.

##  Compatible devices for MLB games

![Person holding a blue Amazon Fire 7 (2022) tablet](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Person-holding-a-blue-Amazon-Fire-7-2022-tablet.jpg)

 You can watch MLB.TV on Prime using any device that is compatible with Prime Video. Thankfully, the list of gadgets that can download is pretty long. Devices that allow you to [download the Amazon Prime Video app](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/splash/getTheApp?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001788&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fhow-to-watch-mlb-games-on-amazon-prime%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) include (but are not limited to):

* Android phones and tablets
* iPhones and iPads
* Fire TV and Fire TV Stick
* Fire Tablet
* Laptops and tablets with Windows 10/11
* Sony Smart TVs
* Samsung Smart TVs
* Panasonic Smart TVs
* LG Smart TVs
* Vizio Smart TVs
* Sony Playstation
* Xbox One

 Keep in mind that in order to watch MLB games on a compatible device, you must have the Prime Video app downloaded, plus internet access. Live-streamed games require either data or a Wi-Fi connection. If you have a poor connection, you may get a lot of buffering or not be able to watch at all.

##  What to know about ending your subscription

 You can cancel your MLB.TV subscription with Amazon Prime and get a full refund for three days after your paid subscription begins. After that, you will have to pay the current billing period after you cancel the channel. You can cancel a channel by going to All > Your Account > Prime Video Channels.

 When you cancel, you will still be able to watch until the end of your current paid period. You won't get a refund for the rest of the month. MLB.TV auto-renews on Amazon Prime every season unless you cancel your subscription before the new season begins.

 If you pay monthly, the channel will even continue after the season has ended, so set a reminder to cancel it if you don't care about off-season content.

 Watching MLB games on Amazon Prime requires a paid channel, but getting MLB.TV does make it easy to watch games on the go. Plus, your Prime Video subscription unlocks thousands of other titles and NFL Thursday Night Football games.
