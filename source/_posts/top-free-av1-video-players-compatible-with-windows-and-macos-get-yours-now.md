AV1 is the abbreviation of AOMedia Video 1, and it is an open and royalty-free video coding format. It is said that [AV1 codec](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) was developed because of the copyright license of HEVC is hard to get and to better handle high-resolution video. Compared with HEVC codec, [the compression efficiency of AV1 has gone by 30%](https://www.multichannel.com/blog/facebook-tests-show-av1-streaming-performance-exceeding-expectations). In any case, compressing video bound to cause a loss of quality, and despite the controversy that AV1 also supports lossless compression, there is no authoritative citation to confirm this.
