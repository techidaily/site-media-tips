## Unlock Savings with DirectTV Stream - Secure Your $90 Off Deal Today Only – Don't Miss Out!

You can save $30 on your first three months of DIRECTV STREAM if you sign up on May 20th or 21st. It's a solid offer for those who want to catch a few MLB and NBA games at a reduced price, as you're free to cancel DIRECTV STREAM after the promotional discount ends.

 DIRECTV SREAM is a live TV service in the vein of YouTube TV or Sling. It provides access to [over 100 cable and broadcast channels](https://streamtv.directv.com/channels/), including sports channels like ESPN, and offers unlimited 9-month DVR storage at a higher quality than its competitors. Additionally, DIRECTV STREAM can simultaneously stream on up to three devices outside of your home (plus up to 20 inside your home) and offers a unique Lookback feature that lets you watch content from up to three days in the past.

 Today's offer brings the price of DIRECTV STREAM's ENTERTAINMENT package down to just $50 a month, rather than the usual price of $80 a month. Of course, you aren't limited to the ENTERTAINMENT package. DirectTV is offering a 3-month $30 discount for _all_ of its STREAM plans. If you're specifically looking for sports, the CHOICE package is a good option—it costs $70 during this promo period.

* **[ENTERTAINMENT](https://www.directv.com/shop/dtvi/entertainment-package)**: $50 (Usually $80)
* **[CHOICE](https://www.directv.com/shop/dtvi/choice-package)**: $70 (Usually $110)
* **[ULTIMATE](https://www.directv.com/shop/dtvi/ultimate-package)**: $90 (Usually $120)
* **[PREMIER](https://www.directv.com/shop/dtvi/premier-package)**: $135 (Usually $165)
* **[OPTIMO MAS](https://www.directv.com/shop/dtvi/optimo-mas-package)**: $50 (Usually $80)

 However, I should note that [YouTube TV](https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/) is running a very similar 3-month discount for first-time subscribers. If you join YouTube TV today, you'll pay $58 for your first three months and $73 thereafter. While DIRECTV STREAM and YouTube TV offer a similar channel selection, YouTube TV is the home of the NFL Sunday Ticket (which costs a few hundred dollars extra) and includes more sports content in its entry-level tier.

 Customers can secure a $30 discount on their first three months of DIRECTV STREAM on May 20th and 21st. This offer does not require an active DirecTV or AT&T plan, though it's only available to new and returning DIRECTV STREAM customers. The DIRECTV STREAM service previously required a contract, but this requirement has been dissolved—you can cancel your subscription after the 3-month promo ends, if you want.
