iPadOS 15 is new but **iPadOS 15 screen mirroring** is not difficult to enable, as iPadOS 15 is built on the same foundation as iOS 14/15 that screen mirroring is the basic feature to both platforms. Besides, after experiment, we find that screen mirroring on iPadOS 15/14 is quite the same as that on iOS 15/14 iPhones. So, if you know how to AirPlay mirroring iPhone, you will know how to screen mirror iPadOS iPad to Mac, PC or Apple TV.

**What is iPadOS? Is iPadOS Screen Mirroring Different from iOS Mirroring?**

As the rebranded iOS on tablets, iPadOS is a new concept that Apple introduces to iPad models to further differentiate features between the iPads and the iPhones. Despite that there are quite a bit differences between iOS and iPadOS, Apple didn't tell quite definitely that the screen mirroring feature is different on the two platforms or not. Therefore, we can assure that the AirPlay mirroring on iPadOS 15 is the same as [AirPlay on iOS 14/15](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/).

Different from iOS, iPadOS is multitasking, more powerful and allows for more options on your iPad models. The Slide Over and Split View lets multiple apps work in the same interface, the refined layout will enable you to see more details on iPad, the Apple Pencil will offer more accurate drawing or marking, and all of the superiority will be amplified by the iPadOS screen mirroring ability. What's more surprising, you can even display Mac screen and app contents on iPadOS 15 through [Sidecar mirroring](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/).

**iPadOS 15 Mirroring Supported Devices**

iPadOS 15 is smarter than iOS 15 and is specifically designed for iPad devices, which means not all Apple devices will support iPadOS. iPads with an Apple A8/A8X chip or later will allows for iPadOS download, including iPad Pro 12.9-inch (5th generation), iPad Pro 11-inch (3rd generation), iPad Pro 12.9-inch (4th generation), iPad Pro 11-inch (2nd generation), iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation), iPad Pro 11-inch (1st generation), iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2nd generation), iPad Pro 12.9-inch (1st generation), iPad Pro 10.5-inch, iPad Pro 9.7-inch, iPad (8th generation), iPad (7th generation), iPad (6th generation), iPad (5th generation), iPad mini (5th generation), iPad mini 4, iPad Air (4th generation), iPad Air (3rd generation) and iPad Air 2, but with exception of iPad mini 4 (released in September 2015) and iPad Air 2 (released in October 2014). Other devices won't support iPadOS 15 AirPlay mirroring.

**AirPlay iPadOS 15 to Mac/PC/Apple TV for a Better Video Music Streaming**

Enjoying contents on iPad is indeed much better than on iPhone, but the screen size is not that satisfying compared to computer and TV. iPadOS 15 screen mirroring makes it available when streaming iPad contents on bigger screen with clearer images and dulcet sounds, especially when you playing videos or movies. Also, AirPlay iPadOS 15 music to more than one speakers gives you an 360-degree surround sound effect, quite like the effect in the cinema. 

**iPadOS 15 Screen Mirroring Also Supports for Game Play from iPad to Computer**

Good news, the new iPadOS 15 will add support for Sony PlayStation 4 DualShock 4 controller and Bluetooth-compatible Xbox One controllers. With the release of Apple Arcade, you are able to pair your game controller to iPadOS 15 as well as iOS 15 and tvOS 14, thus to play games on iPadOS/iOS 15/tvOS 14 with PS4 or Xbox One controller. With iPadOS screen mirror function, you can easily [play games on iPadOS to computer with PS4/Xbox One controller](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) now.
