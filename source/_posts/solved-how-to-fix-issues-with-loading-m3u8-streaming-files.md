![Cannot Load M3U8: Crossdomain Access Denied](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/cannot-load-m3u8-crossdomain-access-denied.jpg) 

_\- "Anytime I try to watch a video on the site it gives me an error saying 'Cannot load M3U8 crossdomain access denied.' Does anyone know what I can do to fix this?"_

Usually it is a problem caused by a proxy server or school/corporate firewall blocking your access. According to your browser, you can disable ad-block, extension or just change the browser settings:

**On IE:** Go to "Internet Options" > "Security" > "Internet" > choose "Custom Level" and scroll down to "Miscellaneous" > find "Access data sources across domain" > set this to "Enable" > restart your browser.  
 As Chrome and Firefox internally refer to IE backed settings, the "Cannot load M3U8" problem on Chrome and Firefox would be solved as well after reset your IE. If this doesn't work for your Chrome or Firefox browser, you can go on reading.

**On Chrome:**  
 Method 1\. Go to Settings > Advanced > Content Settings > Flash > Allow.  
 Method 2\. Reset Chrome to factory default settings.  
 Method 3\. Create a new user and sign in using your Google account.  
 Method 4\. Toggle Use hardware acceleration: Go to Chrome Menu > click Settings > click Show Advanced Settings > scroll down to "System" and "uncheck/check Use hardware when available" > restart Chrome.  
 Method 5\. If you have any antivirus or firewall, ensure that it is trusted by Chrome or just disable them to see if it works.

**On Firefox:**  
 From Mozilla Support Forum, we found the most useful solution is trying to update the extensions and flash player M3U8 video streaming.

Also, the "Cannot load M3U8: crossdomain access denied" error occurs if the online [M3U8 player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) is not that powerful when you directly watch a video on a site.

**Cannot Load M3U8 Occurs on Plex and Twitch? You Can:**  
 Go to "Internet Options" of IE > "Security" > "Internet" > choose "Custom Level" and scroll down to "Miscellaneous" > find "Access data sources across domain" and set this to "Enable".  
 Or if you have installed and enabled a browser extension like "HTTPS Everywhere" during M3U8 video streaming, please disable that extension to solve the problem.

**JWPlayer Cannot Load M3U8: Crossdomain Access Denied? You Can:**  
 Often the case, when M3U8 cannot load on JWPlayer, there often comes with and error code 2048\. And JWPlayer officially suggests you to upgrade the player to solve the problem.

_\- "I got this strange message today when trying to play an MP4 movie with AC3 Audio in Plex/Web. Direct Stream and Direct Play enabled, but Flash Player starts in Chrome on OS X. After trying a second time the movie starts without problems. Any clue?"_

It is a typical HTTP-standard respond code indicating that the client was able to communicate with a given server, but the server could not find what was requested. You will get this issue not strictly with MP4 or MKV formatted files, but the most possible reason is that the file has been removed from the website.

**Solutions to Cannot Load M3U8: 404 not Found:**  
 1\. Retry the web page by pressing F5, clicking the refresh/reload button or trying the URL from the address bar again.  
 2\. Check if your URL is typed wrong.  
 3\. Clear browser's cache and cookies.  
 4\. If an entire website is giving you a 404 error or if the website is working on other networks, change the DNS servers used by your computer.  
 5\. Contact the website directly to make sure if the site owner removes the page, if it is true, they would like to redirect you to a new page with the same contents.

Some people said that they solve the 404 not found error successfully by [playing M3U8 file with VLC](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/), and so you are also suggested to try it if the above solutions are not workable for you.
