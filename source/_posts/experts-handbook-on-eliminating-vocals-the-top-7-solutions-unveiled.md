## Part 1\. 4 Crucial Reminder Before Selecting a Background Noise Canceling Microphone

### 1\. Directionality

 It refers to the directional sensitivity of a microphone from the sound coming from different directions. There are different types of directional microphones, and each has its characteristics. Here are the samples you need to know:

| Type of Directionality Microphone      | Short Description                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Omnidirectional Microphones            | Pick up all sounds equally in all directions. Best for recording ambient sound and sense of space recording.                             |
| Cardioid or Unidirectional Microphones | They are the most sensitive to the sound coming from the front but different from other sides. Commonly used for vocals and instruments. |
| Bidirectional or Figure Microphones    | Equally, pick up all sounds from the front and rear but not on the sides. Best for recording interviews.                                 |
| Shotgun Microphones                    | Pick up a sound from a narrow beam before the microphone. Best for recording dialogs in film and TV production.                          |

### 2\. Connection

 It is essential to know the connection of your microphone, whether it is a USB, XLR, or 3.5mm jack suitable for your recording setup. Without the compatibility connector, even if you purchase the most expensive one, you can't use a reduced background noise microphone if the connector isn't compatible.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Size

 Size does matter when it comes to the microphone. However, some microphones that are large enough aren't compatible with the setup you have made.

## Part 5\. FAQs on the Noise Canceling Microphones

What is noise canceling?

[Noise canceling](https://tools.techidaily.com/) is the process of reducing, minimizing, or eliminating that are generated from natural causes or electrical causes. With this, you can minimize the noises generated during recording before it reaches the device you used to record. If you use noise-canceling headphones, this feature reduces the noise before it reaches your ears.

 How to turn on/off noise canceling on Airpods?

 You can go to Settings and, under Noise Control, activate the Noise Cancellation mode. There are more ways[to turn on/off noise canceling on AirPods](https://tools.techidaily.com/) , but this is the most effective way.

 Do I need to purchase an expensive noise-canceling microphone?

 If you have the money to purchase a more expensive microphone, such as the Shure MV7, that is an excellent pick-up for those who want a more active noise-canceling mode feature. But if you are on a tight budget, you can still purchase a low-cost microphone that offers the same noise canceling, but some mics aren't too effective in recording without noise, unlike the expensive ones.

Conclusion

 If you need a background noise-canceling microphone, you can purchase the devices mentioned in this article. But if you don't have the budget to purchase one and have already recorded the content you want with noises, then you can use the application we have added to make the audio more transparent and better without paying too much here.
