## How to Stream PC to Smart TV? Compare and Choose Best Way

 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: May 18, 2020_

Streaming from PC to smart TV seems very easy, almost all smart TVs like Sony, LG, Samsung as well as PCs include Windows 8 and Windows 10 have built-in the media streaming support now. However, sometimes we find that the Media Streaming options cannot be turned on because of the lossing of referral file or conflicting with other system settings. PC users have tried to fix the problem but it seems much more complex than our imagination. 

![methods to solve media streaming options cannot turn on](https://www.5kplayer.com/dlna/img/windows-media-streaming-cannot-turn-on.jpg)

Tried 12 ways (should include the "saying 'pleeeeeeeeeeease' to computer" as the NO. 13 method?) to fix but all in vain? Turned on the media streaming server on the smart TV, but it failed to search and connect to the PC? Don’t worry, here is the comparison of different methods to help you to find the easiest and most efficient way to achieve streaming from Windows PC to smart TV. 

## Compare the Methods to Stream from PC to Smart TV

**1\. HDMI Cable**

Hooking up PC to smart TV through an HDMI cable could be the earliest way to enable media streaming features between devices, and you can use it on old TV which without media streaming server built-in. You do not need to worry about the speed of Wi-Fi network, the problem of Bluetooth, nor streaming server features in the equipment, as long as the computer and TV can match the HDMI cable port, the wireless transmission function can be realized.

For different types, brands and models of PC, the adapters for HDMI cable are different. If you own more than one PC, for example, we often have a desktop PC sits at home and carry a laptop with us, and more than HDMI cable may be needed. On Amazon, HDMI cables are not expensive, but take care of the length of cable, I don't think you want a cable so short that your computer can just sit on top of the TV.

**☆ Price:**  
 $5 - $20 on Amazon

**☆ Pros:**   
Cheap  
Adapt to old devices  
Support 4K streaming  
High speed transmission without delay 

**☆ Cons:**   
Inconvenient wired transmission   
 Cable may not be recognized (feasible)   
Easy to be damaged by multiple unplugging

**2\. Wireless Display Kit**

If the physical cable between devices is the last thing you like, wireless display kit as the evolution of the former could be a better choice. Wireless display kit also known as wireless HDMI kit, the external adapted kit usually includes two parts, a transmitter and a receiver for PC and TV to stream media content. If you want to stream to smart TV from PC, connect the transmitter to PC and the receiver to TV, and then select the correct HDMI input and the devices are ready to work.

Some wireless display kits are point-to-point connecting, if you lost one part of the two, the other one cannot be used anymore. Moreover, some kits do not work through point to point, and if anyone of the both devices (PC and smart TV) has the media streaming function, you do not need to buy the kit, and buy only the transmitter or receiver would be much cheaper.

**☆ Price:**  
 $120 - $300 on Amazon

**☆ Pros:**   
 Wireless Transmission  
 Adapt to PS4, Drone, Camera and other devices

**☆ Cons:**   
 Expensive  
 Choppy   
 Distance and wall cause issues

### For Streaming Games from PC to Smart TV

For games, wireless streaming from PC to smart TV may cause control delay, picture choppy or other issues, especially for some action game with high speed moving picture or massively multiplayer online games. Otherwise, for playing basic games like Hearthstone, The Elder Scrolls: Legends, RuneScape, etc., wireless streaming can work pretty well.
