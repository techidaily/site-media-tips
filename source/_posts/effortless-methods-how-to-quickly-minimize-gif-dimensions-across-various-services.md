## Part 1\. How to Save a GIF from Twitter/X on Your Desktop

 When you see a GIF, you want to download on Twitter/X, you may right-click on it and look for the Save GIF option by force of habit. When you do that, you will only get the Copy GIF Address option. Twitter does not give a direct download button. So, you have to rely on some related Twitter downloading websites or browser extensions.

### Download GIFs from Twitter with Online Tools

 Many free online Twitter video downloaders and URL-to-GIF converters claim to easily save Twitter GIFs. However, some of them can’t analyze Twitter GIFs.

 There are many other online Twitter GIF downloading tools offered on the market. Popular ones include Twitter Video Downloader, Ezgif, and Convertio URL to GIF. However, through my tests, they may fail to analyze the Twitter GIF you want to save.

## Part 2\. How to Save GIFs from Twitter on iPhone and Android Phone

 Like the web version, the X or Twitter mobile app does not allow you to save GIFs directly on your iPhone or Android phone. Still, you need a third-party app or website to download those short, looping animations. Both the App Store and Google Play Store provide a variety of related apps specifically designed to[download GIFs](https://tools.techidaily.com/) from Twitter. You should check their features, reviews, ratings, and other information to select a reputable one.
