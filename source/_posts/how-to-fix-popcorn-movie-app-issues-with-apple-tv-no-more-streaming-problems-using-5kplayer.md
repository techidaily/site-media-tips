You may wonder what is exactly going wrong with **popcorn not AirPlay Apple TV issue**; is it PopcornTime or the new ATV? Or maybe both? But, diagnosing the devices without a professional fixer can be really hard. Here is what we can do with the software.

## How to Solve Popcorn not Stream to Apple TV?

As AirPlay has rolled back into the newest version (3.8.2) of PopcornTime (.io), it seems that you do not need to test through all the workarounds provided in the popcorntime forum to make popcorn AirPlay Apple TV work again. Download the latest version of popcorn time and check if that version of popcorn handles AirPlay smoothly on your computer. 

However, some of you may still stuck in the dark with the latest version of popcorn not showing AirPlay Apple-TV. 

1\. Make sure that you've done a clean install of PopcornTime;   
2\. Make sure that you've turned off the firewall on Yosmite (if it is a Yosmite) and restart the Apple TV before AirPlay;  
3\. Make use of [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) freeware from DearMob if you are still troubled by 0.3.8 Popcorn not stream to Apple TV.

This is a whole replacement of PopcornTime, 5KPlayer utilizes the bonjour protocol to enable both your Mac and Windows PC to [stream videos to Apple TV](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) and receive [streams from iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/)/iPad/iPod/Apple Watch. The upgraded 5KPlayer Mac version added mirroring and screen recording function to help mirror and record iDevices/Mac screen, which multiplies the Apple AirPlay allowed paths. So, if you are a PopcornTime mobile user, you can always get the videos recorded and saved in the computer instead of in the storage strapped little phones.

Also, DearMob 5KPlayer supports up to 4K/8K UHD video stream and download, able to blow your eyes off with best visual presentation plus a big TV screen. With 5KPlayer, you can free download bunches of TV series, movies, music videos and songs from [over 300 online sharing sites](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/) like StupidVideos, Metacafe, Soundcloud, Onlinemovies.pro etc.

Besides, it is reported that though Popcorn to Apple AirPlay starts to work well with the newest build, subtitle still fails to function. 5KPlayer fills up that gap for you. You can [add subtitles](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) to the video through 5KPlayer and then AirPlay to Apple TV/Mac/Windows.
