Since the Control Center has been completely redesigned, is there any difference between iOS 15 Mirroring and iOS 14/13/12/11/10/9/8 Mirroring? Go ahead to find the answer.

Among the three major overhauls of iOS Control Center, iOS 11 Control Center renewals most yet gets kinda mess with various controls and toggles that many people complain its complexity and chaos. Obviously, iOS 11 Screen Mirroring also gets the shot.  
_\- "I found my first potential issue with iOS 11...where is the option to AirPlay to Apple TV w/o screen mirroring?"_ 
 _\- "mirroring thing doesn't show on iOS 11 plz fix"_ 
 _\- "If you ever used use AirPlay Screen Mirroring feature, stop it. On iOS 10, swipe up to Cntrl Center-select AirPlay screen. Diff in iOS 11"_

However, this feature gets familiar with people over time so that iOS 11\~15 AirPlay mirroring is not that difficult to find out. So, how to enable iOS 15 Screen Mirroring? That all boils down to these three major things:
