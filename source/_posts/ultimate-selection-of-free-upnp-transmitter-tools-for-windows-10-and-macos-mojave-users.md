## Best Free UPnP Player for Windows 10 and Mac

 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

Here we will help discover the **best free UPnP player software** for you to enjoy video streams on TV or elsewhere.

As increasingly more people (at about 10% increasing speed) prefer watching videos and shows on big connected TV set instead of mobile and computers, according to a 2018 report from Conviva, DLNA/UPnP can finally embrace the ripe time to help those escalating smart home lovers and home theater builders to beam local contents for better and larger screen enjoyment. To best utilize this protocol, a free UPnP player software is in need.

Do you know that over 200 global multi-industry companies have actually joined DLNA? And that the promoter members include AT&T, Broadcom, CableLabs, Cisco, Comcast, DIRECTV, Dolby Laboratories, DTS, Ericsson, HP, Huawei, Intel, LG, Microsoft, Motorola, Nokia, Panasonic, Samsung, Sharp, Sony, Technicolor, Toshiba, Verizon, etc. So, as long as you own one or two devices from the above companies, which is totally possible, you might be very much likely involved in the net woven by **DLNA/UPnP streaming**!

###  How to Identify A Good DLNA/UPnP Player?

A media player tagged with UPnP/DLNA support does not necessarily make itself a robust UPnP player, since the use of UPnP/DLNA protocol has at least three orientations - server, renderer and controller. And thus, we classify those DLNA/UPnP supported players as below 3 levels:

### Three DLNA/UPnP Media Player Levels

**Silver** level - UPnP player/renderer   
**Gold** level - UPnP player/renderer + UPnP server  
**Platinum** level - UPnP server+ UPnP player/renderer + UPnP controller 

A basic **silver level** UPnP player/renderer can be anything - CXN, PS4/PS3/, XBOX, top-box, smart TV, networked computer that can perform the actual audio or video rendering and playback. They receive UPnP streams and provide the audio/video outcome through connected monitor/speakers. 

The **gold level** UPnP renderer/player plus UPnP server will do more than a stream receiver player. It hosts its own UPnP Media server with content files and allows users to access contents listed from that server, acting as a home media source provider.

The **Platinum level** UPnP player, on top of level-two, ads UPnP controller (UPnP client) utility, also called a control point to detect other UPnP servers, stream to and control playback of UPnP Av Media Renderers. This is most complete UPnP utilization for an UPnP player, which can moonlight as a wireless source provider, a stream sender/controller, and a receiver/player. And this is where 5KPlayer ranked at.

**Open source Silver level UPnP player - VLC UPnP player**

[VLC UPnP player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/dlna/), a free, open-source and cross-platform media player lets the user access the contents listed from an UPnP Media server. Though a very complete media player in itself, it does not provide any UPnP Control Point capabilities, nor can the player be controlled as a UPnP compliant Media Renderer. 

![Plex UPnP](https://www.5kplayer.com/dlna/../video-music-player/img/5kp-plex-player-icon-yxt-052501.jpg) 

**Closed source Gold level UPnP server player - Plex UPnP Player**

Plex UPnP Player is a cross-platform and a closed source media server and entertainment hub, available for macOS, Microsoft Windows, Linux, as well as mobile clients for iOS, including Apple TV (2nd gen) , Android, and Windows Phone.
