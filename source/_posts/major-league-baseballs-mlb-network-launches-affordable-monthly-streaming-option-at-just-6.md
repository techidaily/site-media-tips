## Major League Baseball's MLB Network Launches Affordable Monthly Streaming Option at Just $6

Major League Baseball has launched its own streaming service in the United States, just in time for MLB’s second half and the upcoming Trade Deadline. Plus, MLB is treating fans to a new bundle comprised of MLB Network and At Bat content.

 The new streaming offering is priced at $6/month. For that kind of money, you get to stream MLB Network content, including all studio shows and select out-of-market games. Some programming from the MLB Network channel is unavailable to stream standalone due to licensing restrictions. The company notes, "For all live games on MLB Network, viewers will be subject to local blackouts and will be provided with alternate programming."

 To stream everything the network offers, consider the new MLB Network + At Bat bundle. In exchange for $7/month, you can freely stream MLB Network's content and enjoy every perk included in the MLB At Bat subscription. These include live MLB games, live game audio for all 30 MLB teams, and access to MLB Big Inning.

 Existing MLB.TV subscribers on All Teams and Single Team plans can stream MLB Network for the remainder of the 2024 season at no additional charge. The same applies to future MLB.TV subscribers. It's the first time MLB has offered MLB Network content for standalone streaming.

 The new direct-to-consumer streaming offering won't matter much to you if you already have MLB Network as a paid upgrade through your pay TV provider. [MLB's support page](https://www.mlb.com/network/about/live-streaming-faq) notes that MLB Network subscribers have been able to access a live stream of the MLB Network content (login required) on desktop, iPhone, iPad, and Android phones and tablets at no additional charge for ten years in a row using their authenticated user name and password.

 MLB Network president Bill Morningstar underscored how direct-to-consumer streaming will expand the league's reach to fans. "With the season approaching the trade deadline, pennant chases, and Postseason, MLB Network will provide the most extensive baseball coverage and analysis available anywhere for our viewers,” he said.

 You can [sign up for the MLB Network streaming service](https://www.mlb.com/live-stream-games/subscribe) from the offical website. There's also a 35% off discount for students, military, and first responders.
