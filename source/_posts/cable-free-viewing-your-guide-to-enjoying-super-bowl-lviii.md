##  Watch the Super Bowl for Free With an OTA Antenna

 Since CBS is broadcasted "over the air," it can be watched for free without a cable subscription. The simplest way to do that without messing around with streaming apps is with an OTA TV antenna. Most people have a local CBS affiliate within the range of a cheap antenna.

 First, [check to see if there is indeed a CBS station in your vicinity](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-crossing-platforms-upload-video-to-twittertumblr/). Assuming there is one within 200 miles, the [Gesobyte TV Antenna](https://amazon.com/dp/B0BWSPYRHN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001866&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fwhere-to-watch-the-super-bowl-2024%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) will do the job for $30\. Not only will this be great for watching the Super Bowl in HD without any streaming delay, but you can use it after the game to pick up ABC, FOX, NBC, PBS, and a variety of other free channels.

##  How to Stream Super Bowl 2024

 Since the Super Bowl is on CBS this year, it's pretty easy to know which streaming service will have the game—[Paramount+](https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/156932/175360/3065?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2001866&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F). The service costs $5.99 per month, and there is currently a free seven-day trial (though we wouldn't be surprised if that magically disappears before the Super Bowl).

 The game will also be available to watch on pretty much any streaming service that offers live TV. That includes:

* [YouTube TV](https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/)
* [Hulu with Live TV](https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/156932/564546/9358?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2001866&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Flive-tv)
* [FuboTV](https://www.fubo.tv/welcome)
