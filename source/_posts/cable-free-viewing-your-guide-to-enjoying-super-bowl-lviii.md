We'll show you how to watch Super Bowl LVIII.

##  What Channel Is the Super Bowl On?

 The 2024 Super Bowl LVIII will be broadcast on CBS in the United States. The game rotates through the four major US TV networks—ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC—and this year is CBS' turn. The 2025 Super Bowl will be broadcast on FOX.

##  Watch the Super Bowl for Free With an OTA Antenna

 Since CBS is broadcasted "over the air," it can be watched for free without a cable subscription. The simplest way to do that without messing around with streaming apps is with an OTA TV antenna. Most people have a local CBS affiliate within the range of a cheap antenna.

 First, [check to see if there is indeed a CBS station in your vicinity](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-crossing-platforms-upload-video-to-twittertumblr/). Assuming there is one within 200 miles, the [Gesobyte TV Antenna](https://amazon.com/dp/B0BWSPYRHN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001866&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fwhere-to-watch-the-super-bowl-2024%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) will do the job for $30\. Not only will this be great for watching the Super Bowl in HD without any streaming delay, but you can use it after the game to pick up ABC, FOX, NBC, PBS, and a variety of other free channels.

##  How to Stream Super Bowl 2024

 Since the Super Bowl is on CBS this year, it's pretty easy to know which streaming service will have the game—[Paramount+](https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/156932/175360/3065?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2001866&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F). The service costs $5.99 per month, and there is currently a free seven-day trial (though we wouldn't be surprised if that magically disappears before the Super Bowl).

 The game will also be available to watch on pretty much any streaming service that offers live TV. That includes:

* [YouTube TV](https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/)
* [Hulu with Live TV](https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/156932/564546/9358?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2001866&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Flive-tv)

 OTA is the preferred method to watch the Super Bowl if you can swing it. You don't have to sign up for free trials or download apps, and since it's not streamed over the internet, there's no delay in the broadcast. Let's play some football!
