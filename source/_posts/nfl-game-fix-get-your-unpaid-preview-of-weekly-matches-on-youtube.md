## NFL Game Fix: Get Your Unpaid Preview of Weekly Matches on YouTube

YouTube is the [new home for the NFL Sunday Ticket](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-step-up-your-game-mastering-the-art-of-capturing-playthroughs-for-2024/) after winning the rights from DirecTV for the first time since 1994\. You can tune in directly on YouTube, stream games through YouTube TV, or [with Verizon](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/slicephoto-inspection/). After initially saying it wouldn't offer a free trial, Google quietly ran a reverse and confirmed that it'll offer a free seven-day trial of the NFL Sunday Ticket for those who qualify.

 On a newly updated [YouTube support page](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14001074), the company says it will indeed offer a free trial, allowing for endless streaming of Sunday NFL games for an entire week. The website says, "You may try NFL Sunday Ticket or NFL Sunday Ticket with NFL RedZone on YouTube Primetime Channels or YouTube TV with a 7-day free trial. Current and former NFL Sunday Ticket subscribers on YouTube or YouTube TV are not eligible for this offer."

 Naturally, there are a few restrictions or eligibility requirements, but we're glad that YouTube will follow in DirecTV's footsteps and allow users to try it before buying. This is especially helpful during the transition to YouTube, as NFL fans want to ensure it's an enjoyable experience before handing over $449 or signing up for a payment plan. So, what are those restrictions? For starters, the trial isn't available on monthly payment plans, student plans, or anyone already signed up. Additionally, it's only an option directly from YouTube or YouTube TV, so those signing up through Verizon don't qualify.

 For everything else, this is your typical free trial. When users click the "Get NFL Sunday Ticket" button on the [NFL's YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDVYQ4Zhbm3S2dlz7P1GBDg), they'll see all the payment options. Click next, and you'll get a prompt to sign up for the free seven-day trial during checkout. After the trial ends, you can continue using the service and pay for the ticket or cancel.

 However, it's worth noting that some users aren't seeing the option for a trial yet, myself included. Google's support page says, "If you don't see the 7-day trial at checkout, try again soon." Also, the free trials are only available when you sign up from your computer or mobile browser. As a reminder, the NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube officially kicks off on September 10th with week one of the 2023-24 NFL season. Go Packers!
