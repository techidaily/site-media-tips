## 2. Streamlined and Improved - Discover the New, Effortless Plex Search Experience!

Ever wanted to find a movie in your media server, but Plex just gives you results from other services? That should come to an end as Plex updates its Search function with several quality-of-life improvements. Going forward, Plex will merge repeat search results (from your server, Discover results, etc), and it will prioritize content in your server. When you need to go on a hunt, Plex's new source picker will help you find items in specific media locations, while the full Search page will provide additional filters for content type and location.

 This is a major improvement from Plex's previous Search behavior. Plex used to separate and segment results based on several factors, including the media source location. Looking up a movie or show could be quite the task, as a user's intended search result was often thrown near the bottom of the search list. The debut of Plex's [Discover](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-transform-your-reels-6-advanced-applications-for-instagram/) feature, which allows you to search for content across premium services like Netflix and Disney+, only made things more complicated.

 Here are the minimum supported versions for Plex's new Search functionality:

* Plex Web: 4.114.1
* Plex for Android (Mobile): 9.30.0.3604
* Plex for Android (TV): 9.30.0.3604
* Plex for iOS: 8.25 (rolling out this week)
* Plex for Apple TV: 8.25
* Plex for Roku: 7.7.1
* Plex for Smart TVs: 5.67
* Plex HTPC: 1.47.1
* Plex for Mac/Windows/Linux: 1.77.2

 Along with the improved Search feature, Plex is rolling out an update ([version 1.32.6.7468-07e0d4a7e](https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/16ikai2/new%5Fpublic%5Fpms%5Fversion%5Favailable%5F1326746807e0d4a7e/)) for media servers. This update provides several bug fixes, particularly for the Plex DVR tool (which you may not be familiar with if your Plex server isn't hooked up to [an OTA TV antenna](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-transform-your-color-grading-skills-with-photoshops-luts/)). There are also some bug fixes that address transcoding problems associated with subtitles and newer AMD GPUs. Note that some Plex media server updates must be installed manuallyâ€”keep your server up to date to ensure the latest security safeguards and bug fixes.

 In its [forum post](https://forums.plex.tv/t/new-search-release/853473) outlining these changes, Plex asks that customers keep an eye out for bugs and other problems. You can report any oddities on the [Plex forum](https://forums.plex.tv/latest), but be sure to use the "search" tag to keep things organized and tidy. I also suggest that you search for your problem before reporting it to avoid duplicate threads.
