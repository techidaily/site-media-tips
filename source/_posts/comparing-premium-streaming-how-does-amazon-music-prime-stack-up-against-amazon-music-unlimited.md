 Many music and podcast listeners will get more than enough features to be happy with just Amazon Music Prime. However, there are times when it makes sense to pony up a few bucks for Amazon Prime Unlimited. Here are some pros and cons to consider before you add another subscription service to your monthly budget:

###  Pros:

* **Generous free trial:** As of this writing, you can try unlimited for three months, so you can try it totally for free as long as you [remember to cancel it before the first payment hits](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-enhance-your-file-management-six-tips-for-win-11s-mov-files/).
* **Unlimited skips:** With regular Amazon Music Prime, you can choose a channel, but you're stuck with shuffle mode. That means if you have an itch for _You Can't Hurry Love_ by The Supremes, you can't pull it up on demand. Unlimited allows you to play anything on demand.
* **Personalized stations:** Once you listen to enough songs, Amazon will use its algorithm to create stations just for you, similar to Spotify. You'll need an Amazon Unlimited plan to listen to them.
* **It can be purchased independently:** If you don't need an Amazon Prime account, Amazon Music Unlimited lets you access music and save $4 (Amazon Prime is $14.99 per month, Music Unlimited is $10.99 for non-Prime Members).

###  Cons:

* **No unique content:** If you already pay for Prime and add Amazon Music Unlimited, you won't get any extra songs or podcasts, just easier ways to play them on demand.
* **Device limitations:** Unless you pay for an unlimited family plan, you can't share your account and can only listen on one device at a time.
