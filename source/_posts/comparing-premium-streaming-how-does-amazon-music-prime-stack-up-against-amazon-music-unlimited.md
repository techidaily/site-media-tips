##  Amazon Music Prime vs. Amazon Music Unlimited

 Amazon Prime Music is one of the [many benefits of having a Prime membership](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/deactivating-your-androids-facebook-feature-easy-instructions-inside/). You can download the Amazon Music app to most smartphones and tablets, as well as some Alexa-enabled devices. However, it is "free," and as such, it's limited. If you want additional features that can rival Spotify or Apple Music, you'll want to look toward Amazon Music Unlimited.

##  Pros and Cons of Paying for Amazon Music Unlimited

![Use Amazon Prime Unlimited for about $10 per month.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/amazon-prime-unlimited.jpg) 

 Many music and podcast listeners will get more than enough features to be happy with just Amazon Music Prime. However, there are times when it makes sense to pony up a few bucks for Amazon Prime Unlimited. Here are some pros and cons to consider before you add another subscription service to your monthly budget:

###  Pros:

* **Generous free trial:** As of this writing, you can try unlimited for three months, so you can try it totally for free as long as you [remember to cancel it before the first payment hits](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-enhance-your-file-management-six-tips-for-win-11s-mov-files/).
* **Unlimited skips:** With regular Amazon Music Prime, you can choose a channel, but you're stuck with shuffle mode. That means if you have an itch for _You Can't Hurry Love_ by The Supremes, you can't pull it up on demand. Unlimited allows you to play anything on demand.
* **Personalized stations:** Once you listen to enough songs, Amazon will use its algorithm to create stations just for you, similar to Spotify. You'll need an Amazon Unlimited plan to listen to them.
* **It can be purchased independently:** If you don't need an Amazon Prime account, Amazon Music Unlimited lets you access music and save $4 (Amazon Prime is $14.99 per month, Music Unlimited is $10.99 for non-Prime Members).

###  Cons:

* **No unique content:** If you already pay for Prime and add Amazon Music Unlimited, you won't get any extra songs or podcasts, just easier ways to play them on demand.
* **Device limitations:** Unless you pay for an unlimited family plan, you can't share your account and can only listen on one device at a time.
