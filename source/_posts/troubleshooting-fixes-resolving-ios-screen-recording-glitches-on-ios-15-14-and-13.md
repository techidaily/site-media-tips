**2\. iOS 15/14/13 Screen Recording no Audio**

By design, Apple's brand-new screen recorder let you choose whether or not you're to record both the audio & video, and good news is that AV record at this stage remains pretty in-sync. If you run into the problem of iOS screen recording no audio, check whether you've somehow disabled "Microphone Audio". If yes, tap on the blank white circle to enable voice input, but you'll need to re-do the screen record all from the start.

**3\. iPhone Getting Hot When Recording Screen on iOS 15/14/13**

_"My iPhone 5s is heating up every time I tempt to use screen recorder iOS 14\. What should I do to stop it from exploding!";_ 
_\----- Jeremy from DearMob's Disqus Forum_ 

Overheating is nothing so serious for iPhone, but there's a reason to stop your iPhone from getting warm much too often. Here're 3 useful fix if your screen recording iOS 15/14/13 also brings unwanted temperature to the device:

**Step 1:** Stop Bluetooth and GPS service if you don't need them during the record. These 2 are the most important heating factors for iPhone. On iOS 15/14/13, you can turn Bluetooth off in the Control Center, and visit Settings > Privacy > Location Services to turn it off.   
**Step 2:** Unplug iPhone if it's charging until it cools off.  
**Step 3:** Reboot iPhone > start screen recording all over again.

**4\. Screen Recorder Crashes on iOS 15/14/13**

Sorry to say this but some of the age-old iPhone & iPad models aren't good to go with iOS 15/14/13, here's the list: iOS 12/11 screen recording won't land on 2012's iPhone 5, iPad 4th generation and 2013's iPhone 5C, or earlier devices, and iPhone SE/6 and earlier won't process iOS 15/14/13 screen recording as well, that been said, if you forced the install but recording crashes on one of the above devices, please simply switch to a newer model to try on the new trick.

However, if recording fails half-way, please refer to the resolve in #1 to help iPhone recover.

**5\. How to Edit iOS 15/14/13 Screen Record?**

There're 2 ways to end and record: Re-tap the record icon in Control Center or tap on the blue-head-bar > click on Stop for to stop screen recording. The newly-generated video will be saved to Photos > Camera Roll, with an add-on trimming function like you can do with a recorded voice memo: To edit a length of a screen record, tap on the bottom-line edit icon > manually adjust the number of frames to save out of the record (adjustment is valid when the outline turns yellow) > then tap on Done > Save as New Clip. However, we've not discovered other annotation support alongside this basic trimming function on iOS 15/14/13 screen recording.
