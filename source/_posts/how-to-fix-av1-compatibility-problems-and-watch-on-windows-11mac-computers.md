### **AV1 not Playing on Mac? \[Solved\]**

Though Apple joined the AV1 codec consortium earlier in 2018, it doesn't mean devices like iPhone, Mac and Apple TV support AV1 video playback. In fact, because of the transition to 64-bit technology in macOS in 2019, you will see an alert when using iMovie about the media files that won't be compatible with macOS Catalina. For sure, the incompatible video format includes AV1\. As of now, you can only solve can't play AV1 on Mac problem through converting AV1 to Mac compatible format like HEVC, H.264, MP4, etc if you want to play AV1 videos with the native Mac media player like QuickTime.

**Solution:** As the option to convert the incompatible files will no longer be available on macOS Catalina, you are highly suggested to detect and convert the incompatible video files using iMovie before upgrading to macOS Catalina, so as to make all of the video files compatible with the future versions of macOS. If the method mentioned above doesn't works for you, you can try third-party video converter like WinX Video Converter to convert the AV1 file. 

Obviously, the file you play on Mac now is a converted version which has a totally different video codec. To directly play video files encoded with AV1 codec without changing anything, you may need professional [AV1 player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) to play AV1 on Mac and 5KPlayer is highly recommended.

### **AV1 Playback Issue with VLC**

_"VLC won't play av1\. The decoder seems to be struggling on higher bitrates. I don't think using the nightly build made a lot of difference."_ 
 _"Trying to play Aomedia AV1 video codec in WebM container. VLC 3.0.3 can't really figure out the codec, and fails. While v4.x nightly shows black screen, i.e. cannot decode the video."_

Even the quite new VLC 3.0.8 can't play AV1 video files though [VLC AV1](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) support has been added for a long time, some users said. When playing AV1 with the well-known and versatile VLC media player, sometimes it totally can't play, sometimes the sound plays but no image appears. The fault is probably caused by the wrong version of VLC, or the wrong configuration of VLC. 

**Solution:** Upgrade your VLC media player to the latest version 3.0.10 to see if it works. Or manually set the configuration to the right situation by unchecking the "Use hardware YUV -> RGB conversions" checkbox or set the Output to DirectX, Direct3D, Windows GDI or OpenGL. Or just switch to professional AV1 video player 5KPlayer.
