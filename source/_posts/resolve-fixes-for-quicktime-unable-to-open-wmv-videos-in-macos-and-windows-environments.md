_\- "Have created a movie in Windows Movie Maker on a PC but have to be able to play it on a Mac for school. I saved it in QuickTime, however, QuickTime won't open WMV files. Any easy solution?"_ 
 _\- "Hi, is it possible to play WMV videos on QuickTime Player on Windows platform?"_

So, when you set QuickTime Player by default to play WMV files, an error message "This is not a movie file" pops up to tell that you can't play WMV. How to **solve QuickTime won't play WMV problem** on Mac/Windows? Here are workarounds.
