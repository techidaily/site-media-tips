## Maximize Entertainment with Just $10: Exclusive Offer for Verizon Subscribers - Stream Netflix & More!

Beginning December 7th, Verizon myPlan customers can bundle ad-supported Netflix and Max for just $10 a month. This is in addition to existing myPlan perks, including discounted Walmart+ service and a cheaper Disney Bundle.

 The ad-supported versions of Netflix and Max usually cost $6.99 and $9.99 a month, respectively. Bundling with Verizon myPlan shaves $7 off the total monthly fee. It's a pretty generous offer, assuming that you're already a Verizon myPlan customer.

 Verizon introduced its [myPlan system](https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-key-to-quick-and-effective-small-image-generation/) earlier this year. The idea is pretty simple—myPlan is cheaper than the average Unlimited plan, but it doesn't include any free perks. Instead, you can choose from a selection of perks, which cost an additional $10 each month. The cheapest myPlan package, [Unlimited Welcome](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001226/http://www.verizon.com/plans/unlimited/), starts at $90 a month for customers with four lines.

 Along with the new Netflix and Max bundle, Verizon myPlan offers discounted subscriptions for [Walmart+](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001226/https://www.verizon.com/digital/nsa/nos/ui/products/producthub/newpdp/walmart%5Fperk), the [Disney Bundle](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001226/https://www.verizon.com/solutions-and-services/disneyplus/), [Apple One](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001226/https://www.verizon.com/solutions-and-services/add-ons/entertainment/apple-one/), Apple Music Family, and more. You can also pay $10 a month for 2 TB of Verizon Cloud storage or 100 GB mobile hotspot service. To reiterate, _each_ of these perks costs $10 a month. If you redeem the Netflix and Max deal with the Disney Bundle, you'll pay an additional $20 on your monthly phone bill (it ain't cheap, but it's an excellent price to pay for _five_ streaming services).

 Interestingly, this is the first-ever Netflix and Max bundle. It's rare to see a streaming bundle from two competing corporations—bundling Disney+ and Hulu makes sense, as they're both owned by Disney, but Netflix and Max are an odd pair. It's a clear sign that the streaming market is changing; services are growing far too expensive, so they must be supplemented by ads, bundled into packages, and distributed at a discount through cellular and internet companies. Yeah, cable television reincarnate.

 Verizon will begin offering the Netflix and Max bundle on December 7th. It's exclusive to myPlan subscribers and costs $10 a month. Eligible customers can [select their myPlan perks](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001226/https://www.verizon.com/solutions-and-services/add-ons/) from the Verizon website. Obviously, upgrading to an Unlimited plan just for the perks is a bad idea, but those who are already subscribed to an expensive data plan should see [what Verizon has to offer](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001226/http://www.verizon.com/plans/unlimited/).
