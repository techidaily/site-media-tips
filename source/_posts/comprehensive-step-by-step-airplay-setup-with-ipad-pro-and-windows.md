Airserver/Airparrot are a good tools for Windows AirPlay mirroring but they charges at least $13 for a Windows/Mac. So, at present I must say that [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) is the most ideal free solution for iPadOS iPad Pro 2 to Windows 10 AirPlay, as it works on Windows 10 OS and supports both iPadOS AirPlay mirroring and iPadOS screen recording wirelessly.
