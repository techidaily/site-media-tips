 Amazon Prime Video tracks what you watch to recommend more content you'll enjoy. However, if you share your account with people who have different tastes, they'll also receive recommendations based on your viewing habits. If you don't want this, you can clear your Prime Video watch history.

##  How to Clear Watch History on Amazon Prime Video

 To clear your watch history, visit the Amazon Prime Video website in a browser and then navigate to your Profile > Account & Settings > Watch History. That's where you'll find the option to remove content.

 First, go to the [Amazon.com Prime Video website](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Video/b/?ie=UTF8&node=2858778011&ref%5F=nav%5Fcs%5Fprime%5Fvideo&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001525&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fdelete-amazon-prime-watch-history%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen), click your profile, and choose "Account & Settings."

 Switch to the "Watch History" section.

![Watch History option in Amazon Prime Video.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/watch-history-option-in-amazon-prime-video.jpg) 

 Click "Delete Movie from Watch History" next to the movie you want to remove from the watch history.

 If you want to remove a web series from the watch history, click "Delete Episodes from Watch History" next to it.

 If you want to delete a particular episode of a web series, click the drop-down icon next to "Episodes Watched" of that web series and click the cross icon (X) next to the episode you want to delete.

 That is how you can clear your watch history on Amazon Prime Video. Unfortunately, there is no option to clear your entire watch history at once. You will need to manually delete each episode and movie individually.

##  How to Remove Something From Continue Watching on Amazon Prime Video

 To remove a movie or show from your Continue Watching list on Amazon Prime Video, access the "Options" menu of the title you want to remove and choose "Hide This Movie" or "Hide This Season." This will also hide that title from the home screen and other recommendation pages, but you'll still be able to search for it.

 Amazon Prime Video has a "Continue Watching" section on its homepage that shows movies and TV shows you're currently watching. This section lets you easily pick up where you left off. However, you might want to remove a specific movie or show from your Continue Watching list. Maybe you share your account with others and don't want them to see what you're watching. Luckily, removing items from your Continue Watching list is easy.

###  Delete Content from Continue Watching on the Prime Video Mobile App

 To delete Continue Watching on Prime Video for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001525/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.avod.thirdpartyclient&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) and [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-prime-video/id545519333), open the Amazon Prime Video app on your device, and in the Continue Watching section, long press the movie or show you want to remove. Then, tap on the "Hide This Video" option.

###  Delete Content from Continue Watching on the Prime Video Desktop App

 To delete Continue Watching on the [Prime Video desktop app](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9P6RC76MSMMJ?hl=en-US&gl=US), open the app on your computer, hover over the movie you want to remove from the list, click the three dots, and choose "Hide This Movie."

###  Delete Content from Continue Watching on the Prime Video TV App

 While Amazon Prime Video offers a similar interface across all [smart TV](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/maximizing-zoom-top-strategies-for-chromebooks/) platforms, the specific steps for hiding titles may vary depending on your TV's [operating system](https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/mastering-tech-choices-trustworthy-tips-from-toms-hardware-hub/) and remote control. But the general rule of thumb is to find the "Options" menu for the movie or show you want to remove, then choose the "Hide This Movie" or "Hide This Show" option. For example, here's how to hide content on a Xiaomi Mi TV:

 Open the Prime Video app and move the focus to the movie or show you want to hide. Then, long press the "OK" button on your remote, move the focus to "Hide This Movie," and press the "OK" button. If it's a show, you'll get the "Hide This Show" option.
