## New Feature Alert: Spotify Introduces Live Music Video Playback!

Music streaming platforms have taken over music playback for many people, but if you wanted to actually see the music video of a song you really like, YouTube was still the go-to option for most people. YouTube is, after all, a video streaming platform, and even YouTube Music relies on the regular version of YouTube a lot as well. Spotify, however, wants to be your only stop for everything music, including music videos.

[Spotify](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-navigate-your-way-to-the-best-idevice-apps-for-extracting-content-from-facebook/) has announced that it's integrating music videos into its mobile and desktop apps in select markets. This feature, currently available in 11 countries including Brazil, Colombia, and the U.K., allows subscribers to transition between audio and video content right within the Spotify platform.

 Notably, this feature is exclusive to premium subscribers, so you'll actually need an active subscription to access music videos. You can start playing music videos directly from the "Now Playing" screen, with the album artwork being replaced by the music video that's attached to the song. The app's interface facilitates easy switching between audio and video modes with a simple tap on a button right above the song's title. For desktop users, music videos are displayed in the right-hand column alongside song and artist information. Additionally, Spotify has extended this feature to various TV platforms, including Apple TV, Android TV, Fire TV, gaming consoles, and smart TVs.

 While the initial catalog of music videos may be limited, Spotify has plans to expand its offerings over time, prioritizing a diverse range of genres and artists. It's not the only music streaming app to add music videos to its catalog. YouTube Music has famously done it since its beginnings, with a handy toggle right above the playing interface. Apple Music also had them on a separate section, and doesn't mix them up with your regular songs, an approach that some people might prefer instead. Spotify's approach to this is much more similar (albeit not completely identical) to what YouTube Music is doing.

 If you want to check these out, make sure to keep your Spotify app updated and to live in a country that actually supports them.
