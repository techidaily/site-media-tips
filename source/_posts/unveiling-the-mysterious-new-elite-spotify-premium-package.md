## Unveiling the Mysterious New Elite Spotify Premium Package!

Spotify just raised the prices of its Premium, Duo, and Family plans in the United States. Now, the company is rolling out a new cheaper plan option: Spotify Basic.

 Spotify announced a new plan for “eligible U.S. subscribers,” called Spotify Basic. It mostly works the same as Spotify Premium, with offline support, ad-free music listening, and unlimited skips. The only difference is that it does not include monthly audiobook listening time, and costs $10.99/month instead of $11.99/month.

 Audiobooks are still somewhat new to Spotify. They first [rolled out](https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-engage-and-inspire-viewers-animated-subscribers-in-filmora-explained/) in 2023, and an [audiobook-only subscription for $9.99/month](https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/overcoming-windows-update-failures-strategies-for-error-0x30017/) was introduced back in March. Most people signed up for Spotify probably don’t care about the audiobooks, or don’t even know they are there, so making a slightly cheaper tier without that feature is great.

 There’s one catch: Spotify Basic isn’t one of the plans you can choose from when upgrading a free account. It’s not listed on the [plans page](https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/#plans) alongside Individual, Student, Duo, or Family. It seems like the only way to get Basic is to downgrade from an existing individual Premium plan. At least for now, it’s a hidden option that serves as a last-ditch effort from Spotify to stop you from fully unsubscribing to Premium—a bit like how Adobe will [give customers a discount on some Creative Cloud subscriptions](https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/1baupzl/slightly%5Funethical%5Ftipif%5Fyou%5Fstart%5Fthe/) when they try to cancel.

 There’s also a new Basic Family plan, according to _9to5Google_, which is also not listed on the plans page. It works like the $19.99/month Spotify Premium Family plan, but it doesn’t have included audiobooks and has a lower $16.99/month price.

 Spotify is also rumored to be working on a [new higher-cost premium plan](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-11/spotify-to-introduce-more-expensive-subscription-tier-for-music-lovers?srnd=telecom&embedded-checkout=true), which would include access to high-fidelity audio, like [Tidal’s HiFi Plus](https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-efficient-facebook-video-extraction-procedures/) and [Apple Music’s lossless audio](https://win-forum.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-setting-up-and-enabling-revoappmanager-with-revouninstaller/). According to _Bloomberg_, the plan will be released later in 2024, and will reportedly cost “at least $5 more per month.”

 Hopefully, Spotify Basic will eventually become a regular plan option, instead of a hidden option only accessible to some customers. Spotify really wants you to spend more money, though, so that doesn’t seem likely right now.
