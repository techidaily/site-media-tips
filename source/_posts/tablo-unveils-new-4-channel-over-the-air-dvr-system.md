## Tablo Unveils New 4-Channel Over-The-Air DVR System

Earlier this year, Tablo stepped up with a 4th Generation OTA DVR box and a revamped streaming app. But if the simple dual-tuner Tablo box isn't enough for you, Tablo is now offering a four-tuner model.

 The new Tablo box doesn't plug into your TV. Instead, it plugs into your router and streams broadcast television to all the devices in your home. There's also 128GB of onboard storage for DVR functionality, and Tablo's new app includes [40 FAST channels](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-netflix-location-to-get-more-country-version-on-realme-narzo-60-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/).

 Back in November, we reviewed the [dual-tuner version](https://solve-manuals.techidaily.com/maximize-site-engagement-using-the-innovative-capabilities-of-cookiebot/) of the 4th Gen Tablo box. This new four-tuner model offers double the funâ€”it allows you to stream or record four channels simultaneously. It's the ideal option for obsessive sports fans or large families, though it may be overkill in some households.

 Those who purchase the four-tuner Tablo box _specifically_ for DVR recordings should probably buy an external drive, too. Video saved to the Tablo's onboard storage is compressed to save space, but still, it can only hold 50 hours of video. Plugging an external drive into the Tablo's USB port expands your storage by up to 1,000 hours. Plus, video saved on your external drive will be kept at full quality. Tablo is compatible with external drives up to 8TB in size.

 Note that the 4th Gen Tablo only uses ATSC 1.0 tuners. It isn't compatible with the new ATSC 3.0 standard, which is perfectly understandable, as ATSC 3.0 hardware is costly and [hasn't been widely implemented](https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/approved-unlocking-youtube-writers-royalties-with-ad-driven-earnings-cpm/) by broadcasters. The FCC wants to shut down ATSC 1.0 in 2027, though this deadline may be extended due to ATSC 3.0's slow adoption.
