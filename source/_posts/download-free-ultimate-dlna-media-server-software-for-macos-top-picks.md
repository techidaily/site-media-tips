**1\. Plex DLNA Server for Mac**

Plex's free version is already capable of serving as a great DLNA server for Mac. Easy setup. Dedicated podcasts and news section. This is a good choice to maintain a personal media server on Mac. Plex cloud is dead, and one more annoying thing is its aggressive data collection.

**2\. Serviio DLNA Server for Mac**

Serviio is a free media server for Mac and windows to stream video audio and images to DLNA certified devices. Serviio streams content across various devices on your home network, but figuring out how to get this media server software working takes a lot of effort and patience. Confusing setup. Failed to work on some theoretically compatible devices in testing, and the most intuitive features cost money.

**3\. Universal Media Server for Mac DLNA Streaming**

Universal Media Server is an open source free DLNA-compliant UPnP media server. It allows streaming of media files to a wide range of devices including video game consoles, smart TVs, smartphones, and Blu-ray players. It streams and transcodes multimedia files over a network connection to the rendering device, ensuring that a supported rendering device will receive the content in a format supported by the device. Its web interface support for non-DLNA devices and automatic bit rate adjustment. No remote access options, not easy to set up on home network and difficult to make it work. 

5KPlayer is your second to none **DLNA server for mac**. Beside supporting DLNA/UPnP, this streaming player also supports AirPlay mirroring tech and screen recording. It can also live stream RTSP/3mu8 videos. A must have streaming media player you shouldn't miss!
