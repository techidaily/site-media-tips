## Requirements: PS4 Meida Player + PS 4 Media Server Windows 10/Mac

Whenever you need to stream computer to PS4, the PS4 media player needs to come into play: for classic PlayStation 4 models, the Media Player APP easily helps users stream whatever on a DLNA server to the target TV screen connected to the game console. While for PS4 Pro and PS4 VR models, the APP also receives videos, music & photos stored in a USB driver, on condition that the display supports up to 4K. 

Now that you've launched the PS4 Media Player, and the last step to successfully stream PC to PS4 is a reliable PS4 Media Server Windows 10 or Mac.
