How to **AirPlay with Beamer**? Although it may be quite handy for you to directly stream movies and music from Mac to Apple-TV with a built-in iOS (4.2 or newer) AirPlay feature or a native OS X (Mountain Lion or later) AirPlay mirroring feature, Beamer is capable of drawing much more attention by just focusing on one thing in particular –AirPlay video from Mac to Apple-TV, in the best audio and video quality possible. And as Mac Stories commented –"Beamer does one thing and it does it extremely well!"

## How to Use Beamer to Airplay Videos from Mac to Apple TV?

With high playback quality in regard of image (full HD support) & sound (5.1 surround sound) and support for almost all common formats and codecs, Beamer is an easy and the quickest solution for you to AirPlay video from Mac to Apple TV, as it works just like a regular media player but the video plays on Apple-TV.

How to AirPlay with Beamer to stream videos from Mac to Apple TV? Forget all the limitations you know about AirPlay on the Mac! To realize **Beamer AirPlay video**, all you need to do is to download the Beamer and drag a video onto the interface for AirPlay. The Beamer will automatically detect the AirPlay receivers, and you can select the target receiver in the popup menu by clicking the AirPlay icon at the lower-right corner. The Beamer new 2.0 version also creates playlists to queue up a bunch of videos for watching in succession. Beamer also remembers what you have watched and at what point in the video you stopped watching.
