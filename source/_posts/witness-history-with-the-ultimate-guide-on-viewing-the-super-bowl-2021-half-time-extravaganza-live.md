### Something About Pepsi Super Bowl Halftime Show LV 2023

**1\. Who Will Perform During Super Bowl LV Halftime Show?**

The Weeknd is announced by Pepsi, the NFL and Roc Nation as the top artist to give performances during the halftime show at Raymond James Stadium, who will perform about 12-13 minutes.

_"We are thrilled to have The Weeknd join us in Tampa Bay on the Pepsi Halftime Stage," said Brian Rolapp, NFL Chief Media and Business Officer. "Halftime Show performances have a history of excellence and creativity and we look forward to seeing what he will bring to Super Bowl LV."_

As always, the Super Bowl halftime live show only invites multi-award winning artists to give performances, and The Weeknd has the qualities. As of 2020, he had won 3 Grammy Awards, 5 American Music Awards and 9 Billboard Music Awards. Though his latest album _After Hours_ has some displeasures with 2020 Grammy, it is still the No.1 selling album. In high probability, the Canadian singer and song writer will perform his No.1 hit single _Blinding Lights_ from _After Hours_ album that had stayed 46 weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 and 37 weeks in the top five. Other tracks that may be performed include _Can't Feel My Face_, _Starboy_, _The Hills_, _Heartless_, _Love Me Harder (featuring Ariana Grande)_, _Earned It_, _I Feel It Coming (featuring Daft Punk)_, _Pray For Me (featuring Kendrick Lamar)_, _Call Out My Name_, and _Smile (with Juice Wild)_. BTW, there is no information about the supplementary performers, but you will know them finally when you watch Super Bowl halftime show in front of the TV.

Despite the fact that no paid the performers will get, they are still very happy to do such a thing as they can be exposed to a larger number of audience bigger than any they have ever encountered.
