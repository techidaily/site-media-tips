## BenQ Unveils Stunning Low-Delay, 4K Resolution Projector Series for Enhanced Visual Experience

Last year, BenQ introduced its X Series projectors, which boast premium gaming features like low-latency 4K video. These projectors scored well in [our reviews](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/process-of-screen-sharing-nokia-c22-to-pc-detailed-steps-drfone-by-drfone-android/) and enjoy wide praise from gamers. BenQ is now moving forward with three new X Series projectors—the X500i, X300G, and X3100i.

 The flagship offering in this lineup, BenQ's X3100i, isn't all that different from last year's X3000i. Its 4LED projection system achieves the same 4K resolution, 500,000:1 contrast ratio, and 100% DCI-P3 color coverage that defined the previous model. Input lag reaches a minimum of 16ms in 4K 60Hz mode, though it can dip to 4ms at 1080p 240Hz. And 1.3x zoom, plus keystone correction and other accouterment, allow the projector to accommodate most rooms. It seems that the only notable upgrade is a boost to 3,300 ANSI lumens, up from 3,000 ANSI lumens in the previous model. I can understand the appeal of a brighter image, but it's odd to see such a minor revision.

 Thankfully, the X500i is a bit more interesting. It appears to be an upgraded version of the BenQ TH690ST, a 1080p bulb projector. The new X500i upgrades to a 4LED light source with a 4K resolution, 500,000:1 contrast ratio, 2200 ANSI lumens of brightness, and 84% DCI-P3 color coverage. Its input lag matches that of the X3100i, meaning that you can achieve a minimum 4ms of latency at 1080p 240Hz. I'd also like to note that this projector has 1.2x zoom and weighs 7.9 pounds, nearly half the weight of the flagship X3000i. For those who want a projector with a more convenient form factor (at the cost of reduced color accuracy), this is an interesting option.

 And BenQ's X300G is a totally new thing. It's a portable gaming projector that weighs just 6.6 pounds and has an integrated kickstand. It also measures just 8 inches tall, 7 inches wide, and 7 inches deep—it's very compact, especially for a 4K projector with the same input lag as the large X3100i. Interestingly, the portable X300G can achieve 2000 ANSI lumens of brightness and has a unique motorized zoom system for easy setup. It's similar to the [Samsung Freestyle](https://article-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-beyond-3d-a-comparative-guide-to-metaverse-and-omniverse-realities/) or [XGIMI MoGo 2](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/simplifying-streaming-key-tactics-for-youtube-and-twitch-via-obs-for-2024/), though it's optimized for gaming.

 BenQ's flagship X3100i gaming projector launches on November 3rd for $2,399\. The smaller and slimmer X500i arrives on the same day for $1,699\. Unfortunately, BenQ's portable X300G projector doesn't launch until January of 2024, and it will cost $1,799.
