## iOS 13 Jailbreak Bottleneck - Remain Patient

However, for those iOS 13 jailbreak lovers, the rumor about Apple's new "rootless" security system would be a great nightmare. iOS 13 update will give you features like split screen on the iPad, voice assistant Siri, optimized power consumption, further reduction in occupied space in device memory, but will at the same time bring you unwanted strengthened security against iOS 13 jailbreak. 

It is believed that iOS 13 would be unprecedentedly difficult to jailbreak due to this Rootless system, because this system "is aimed at preventing even administrator-level users from gaining access to certain file systems on an iPhone, iPad or Mac - though it's believed that it can be disabled on the company's desktop OS… Apple has been plugging holes in iOS for years, holes that jailbreakers have historically used to gain access to parts of the system that they would normally not be able to interact with. It's this opening up of iOS at a fundamental level that is likely to be thwarted by Apple's 'Rootless' technology, leaving jailbreakers very much at the beginning of what could be a long and difficult journey."

Thus, this time, it might take our pioneer jailbreakers like Pangu & TaiG a great deal of time and engergy to attack the well-built defense down and us jailbreak lovers a whole lot of patience for the iOS 13 jailbreak wait.
