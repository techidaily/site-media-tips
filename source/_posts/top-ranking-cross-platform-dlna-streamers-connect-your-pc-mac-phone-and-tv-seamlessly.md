### Further Reading: DLNA vs AirPlay

Compared to DLNA, Apple AirPlay is more selective and only works on Apple products like iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and Apple-proved products like acoustics from Pioneer and Sony, while DLNA is much more popular for the billion of DLNA-compliant devices. It is hard to say which one is better as different people have different demands, while they are totally two different protocols so that DLNA and AirPlay won't talk to each other natively, hence meaning that you can't DLNA contents to only AirPlay-enabled devices or AirPlay video music to only DLNA-compatible equipments.

However, chance is that if a device or software is both DLNA-compliant and AirPlay-enabled, you are allowed to get benefits from DLNA as well as AirPlay streaming simultaneously.
