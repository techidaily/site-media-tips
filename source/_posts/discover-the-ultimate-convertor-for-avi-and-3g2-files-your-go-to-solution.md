## Part 1\. SWF vs. MP4 and Why Convert SWF to MP4

SWF (Small Web Format) is mainly designed for delivering video content on the web. SWF files can contain animations, graphics, and scripts. However, due to the reliance on Flash plugins, SWF is incompatible with most modern browsers.

MP4 (MPEG-4 Part 14) can be the most popular multimedia container format. It can store video, audio, and subtitles in a single file. Its compatibility makes MP4 the perfect format for online video distribution and offline playback.

 Modern devices, platforms, and media players can widely support MP4 files. They don’t need the outdated Flash plugins or specific software to access the content. By converting SWF files to MP4, you can ensure they remain accessible and playable. Moreover, converting to MP4 allows for easy sharing across various platforms and devices.

Step 1.

 Download and install this introduced SWF to MP4 converter on your computer. Launch it and add your SWF files. Besides SWF, the conversion software supports many other video and audio formats, up to 1000 formats.

![Add SWF Files Mac VCU](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/resource/swf-to-mp4-converter/add-swf-files-mac-vcu.jpg)

Step 2.

 Click the Edit button next to the added SWF file to access the editing tools. You use them to trim unwanted sections, crop the video frame, adjust brightness and contrast, and add watermarks as desired.

Step 4.

 Pick the destination location where you want to save the converted MP4\. After that, click the Convert All button to begin the SWF to MP4 conversion process.

## Part 3\. Open-Source HandBrake SWF to MP4 Converter

 While[HandBrake](https://tools.techidaily.com/) is a powerful open-source video transcoder, it doesn't support direct SWF to MP4 conversion. HandBrake primarily focuses on converting video formats like MP4, MKV, and AVI. To convert SWF to MP4 using HandBrake, you need an additional tool called Gnash. It is free and open-source software that can access the visual and sound content from an SWF file.

![HandBrake Open Source MP4 to MOV Converter](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/resource/mp4-to-mov-converter/handbrake-open-source-mp4-to-mov-converter.jpg)

 Use the dump-gnash command to extract video and audio from your SWF file. Open HandBrake and then click Open Source to select the extracted video file.

 Under the Output Settings tab, choose MP4 as the format. You can adjust various settings. Then, click Start Encode to begin the conversion from SWF to MP4\. This conversion solution is more complex. Compared to using dedicated[SWF to MP4 converters](https://tools.techidaily.com/) , HandBrake requires more technical knowledge.
