### Choose Amazon Streaming Server Devices or Media Server Software?

Amazon has many different external equipment media servers on sale, and the two mainstream media server devices are the wireless HDMI and media storage server. The former one is streaming display adapter that is very similar to Google Chromecast, and the latter one is much more expensive, it works by store video files to the drive and then links to a monitor, PC or TV to make the video playback come true.

However, wireless HDMI kit usually works for streaming from mobile to smart TV only. And media storage server is very expensive and more suitable for people who have a large amount of DVDs and downloaded movies to form a personal media library.

Media server software provides more options. No matter you want to turn your PC/Mac a media server, or want to break the restrictions across different platforms, such as streaming from iPhone to Windows PC, you can always find one of them to meet your needs. So, if you want to stream from Android to Windows, install the DLNA supported program on PC; if you want to stream from iPhone to Mac, install the AirPlay supported program on Mac. But here, we recommend 5KPlayer, the all-in-one media server program with DLNA and AirPlay features to help you to achieve infinite multi-screen share.

**Step 3**: Go to your iPhone, call out control center, and tap "Screen Mirroring" icon. Then your iPhone will search and recognize your PC. If you are an Android, go to "Settings > Smart Mirroring", and choose the video you want to stream to PC, then your Android will start searching devices.

**Step 4**: After your PC is showed on the searching list, tap to select it, and you will see your iOS screen on 5KPlayer, then go to open the video on iPhone and it will automatically be streamed to PC. 

**Note**: Make sure that the format of your file works with AirPlay, since AirPlay only supports the following audio and video formats: Video –MOV, MP4, M4V; Audio –MP3, M4A, AAC. If not, for audio files, you can convert the file format into MP3 and ACC directly by 5KPlayer; but for video files, you may need a [video converter software](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) for Mac OS or Windows PC to convert your videos first.
