## YouTube TV Upgrades: Experience Crystal Clear Visuals in 1080P

You may notice a boost in quality throughout the YouTube TV streaming service. Some channels now stream at 1080p Enhanced quality on YouTube TV, provided that you own a compatible streaming device and have a high-speed internet connection. This quality option is available to all YouTube TV users and doesn't require an add-on package.

 The 1080p Enhanced technology, which previously debuted on [YouTube](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-comparison-adobe-storage-vs-non-adobe-options/), increases the bitrate of some 1080p YouTube TV channels. Video resolution hasn't improved, but overall video quality should be more detailed and less jittery on supported channels. YouTube TV announced that it was testing an improved bitrate in [April 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/12tj6jo/april%5Fupdate%5Ffrom%5Fyoutube/?sort=new), so it's been a long time coming.

 For those wondering, YouTube TV _does_ offer 4K streaming with an optional add-on. But the video that it receives from broadcasters is usually 720p or 1080i, and streaming requires a fair bit of video compression. Convincing broadcasters to improve their video resolution is a pipe dream, but an improved bitrate reduces the need for harsh compression. While YouTube TV won't match the quality of some over-the-air or satellite channels, 1080p Enhanced streaming may exceed cable quality, though results will vary by channel.

 The 1080p Enhanced setting requires a 4K streaming device with support for Google's VP9 codec. Most 4K streaming devices, including the Apple TV 4K, NVIDIA Sheild TV Pro, Chromecast with Google TV 4K, Fire TV Stick 4K, and Xbox Series X support the VP9 codec. This quality setting will be automatically applied when available, so long as your preferred video quality isn't set to 720p or standard 1080p.

 In addition to the 1080p Enhanced option, YouTube TV has "[made some changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/1afg5g9/comment/koauldm/?utm%5Fsource=share&utm%5Fmedium=web2x&context=3)" to improve the quality of Start TV. We don't know what changes were madeâ€”presumably, YouTube TV has adjusted its compression algorithm or established a higher-quality feed with Start TV's operators. Some customers now hope to see these "changes" applied to FOX-owned channels, which tend to look a little rough on YouTube TV.

 The price of YouTube TV is currently $72.99 a month, so any improvement in quality is appreciated. The 1080p Enhanced option will be particularly useful when viewing YouTube TV's sports catelog, which has grown substantially over the last few years and included the [NFL Sunday Ticket](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-sage-select-best-general-knowledge-channels/) in 2023.
