**Cons of Listening to Apple Music with iTunes**

#### **Method 2\. Play Apple Music on PC via Apple Music Web Player**

Apple Music is getting a big expansion by officially releasing a web-based player, so as to compete with competitors like Spotify and Amazon Music that both have mobile apps and web players. The beta version of [Apple Music web player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) was first released in September of 2019 and now subscribers can access the official web player to find entire Apple Music catalog and radio stations. Apple says the web version of Apple Music works in any web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari) on all platforms including macOS, Windows, Chrome OS, iOS and Android. As long as you have network, you can listen to Apple Music on any platforms.

**Cons of Apple Music Web Player**

As mentioned above, network is a necessity to access Apple Music in browsers. Since it is quite new, it may not include all the Apple Music categories, the missing features include the Beats 1 live broadcast, smart playlists and original music videos. From my personal experience, Apple Music web payer responds so slowly when the network is weak, and unknown errors pop up often. Besides, the web player doesn’t support downloading function and displaying lyrics as of now.

#### **Method 3\. Play Apple Music on Computer through Apple Music Player for PC**

Disadvantages of iTunes and Apple Music web player are obvious and disappointing, thus you may need third-party Apple Music player for PC - 5KPlayer. It is a totally different way for you to listen to Apple Music on Windows PC by wirelessly streaming Apple Music from iPhone, iPad, iPod and Apple Watch to computer.

With inbuilt [AirPlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) ability, 5KPlayer helps turn your Windows or Mac computer into an AirPlay receiver to receive anything streamed from iOS device, covering Apple Music, live radio stations, videos, movies, Podcasts, photos, spreadsheets, presentations, games, PDFs, etc. In case needed, each line of lyrics appears in time along with the music so you can follow along when you listen. Use 5KPlayer, and jam Lady Gaga’s Chromatica, Taylor Swift’s Lover or Camila Cabello’s Romance on a loop.

**Step 1.** Connect your iOS device and Windows PC to the same WiFi network.

**Step 2.** Click on the download button below to free download 5KPlayer, install and launch it on your PC computer. Then, click on the “DLNA AirPlay” button on the main UI of 5KPlayer to access the AirPlay Setting windows and turn on the AirPlay service option.

 • For iPhone with iOS 13 or later: Swipe down from the top right corner of the screen of your iPhone/iPad to access the Control Center.  
 • For iPhone with iOS 12 or older: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen of your iPhone/iPad to access the Control Center.

**Cons of Playing Apple Music on PC with 5KPlayer**

Like Apple Music web player, 5KPlayer needs network to receive Apple Music. Currently, you can’t stream Apple Music video to PC via 5KPlayer, but 5KPlayer developer team is working hard to fix the error.

**However**, regardless of the two cons, streaming Apple Music on PC via 5KPlayer is great. Besides that, nearly all contents on iOS device can be streamed to Mac/PC wirelessly, smoothly and with no quality loss through this way.
