**1\. AirPlay vs AirPlay 2**

The major [difference between AirPlay and AirPlay 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/)is that the latter introduces a killer feature for audio streaming - offering multi-room audio, which means that you can play back different songs in different rooms with multiple speakers simultaneously. Users can also easily control each AirPlay 2 receiver devices from the control center as a central wireless controller. As for streaming videos, the two AirPlay versions are basically the same - one-on-one device video streaming for bigger screen enjoyment. AirPlay only wins over AirPlay 2 at supporting older device models.  
**Verdict: AirPlay 2.0 is an obvious upgrade on AirPlay 1.0**, but if your devices are incompatible with AirPlay 2 protocol, none of the advantages matters.

**2\. AirPlay 2 vs DLNA**

DLNA provides wider device support and freedom for video audio streaming than **AirPlay 2 for Android** and other none Apple devices. For a long time already, DLNA server utility can let users play back different songs and movies in different rooms with multiple devices simultaneously. DLNA server utility turns your PC into a media server so that stored songs, movies can be accessed from different speaker, mobile devices and TV sets. Yet AirPlay 2 can only realize the audio part. A lot of DLNA supported speakers, clients, renderers including AT&T, Broadcom, CableLabs, Cisco, Comcast, DIRECTV, Dolby Laboratories, DTS, Ericsson, HP, Huawei, Intel, LG, Microsoft, Motorola, Nokia, Panasonic, Samsung, Sharp, Sony, Technicolor, Toshiba, Verizon, have support for this protocol and are not restricted to Apple ecosystem. The only defect of DLNA streaming compared to AirPlay 2 is that the former cannot simultaneously control all the connected devices at one go.  
**Verdict: AirPlay 2 cannot compete with DLNA over different video simultaneous streaming.**

To use AirPlay 2 you will have to meet three requirements, i.e. **an iOS 11.4 iPhone/iPad device** \+ **an AirPlay 2 speaker** \+ **same WIFI connection**.

And the iPhone 5 and 5C, as well as iPad 4 and the very first iPad mini, are not supported by iOS 11.4\. Also note that Apple TV when running tvOS 11.4 (4th & 5th gen) can receive AirPlay 2 protocol. This might rule out a lot old iPhone users to enjoy new AirPlay 2 new features.

**Step 2:** As for **AirPlay 2 compatible speakers**, Apple Home App has already presented us with twenty-three AirPlay 2 speaker/receiver models, from its own Apple HomePod to third party speakers including Beoplay/BeoSound, Denon, Libratone, Marantz, Naim, Sonos.
