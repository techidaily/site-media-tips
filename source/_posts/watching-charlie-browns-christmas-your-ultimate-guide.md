 After decades of airing on CBS and then on ABC, A Charlie Brown Christmas moved [exclusively to Apple TV+](https://www.reviewgeek.com/57660/apple-tv-adds-classic-peanuts-specials-today-with-new-ones-on-the-way/) in 2020 along with fellow Peanuts holiday specials _It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown_ and _[A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving](https://win-able.techidaily.com/hyper-scape-no-more-pc-crashing-solutions-unveiled/)_. Thanks to fan outcry, A Charlie Brown Christmas also [aired on PBS](https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2020/11/apple-and-pbs-team-up-for-special-broadcast-airings-of-a-charlie-brown-thanksgiving-and-a-charlie-brown-christmas/) while remaining available on Apple TV+, and that continued in 2021 as well.
