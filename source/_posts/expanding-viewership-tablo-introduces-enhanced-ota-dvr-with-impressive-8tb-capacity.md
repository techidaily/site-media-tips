## Expanding Viewership: Tablo Introduces Enhanced OTA DVR with Impressive 8TB Capacity

Some of you cord-cutters out there might be familiar with the name Tablo. If you cancelled your cable or satellite TV provider, or never had it in the first place, a Tablo DVR will let you access some [free local OTA channels](https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-a-non-functioning-steelseries-arctis-pro-microphone-complete-solution/) in addition to the streaming services you're currently subscribed to. Now, Tablo has released a fourth-gen DVR, and it's better than ever.

 Tablo has introduced a sleek new DVR model. The most notable feature, apart from the new stylish white round design, is the fact that it comes with up to 128GB of storage as well as the option to add up to 8TB via external hard drives, possibly making it the ultimate recording DVR. It also integrates live free streaming channels into Tablo's live TV guide, similar to Roku TVs, and it has also launched a new app compatible with various platforms such as Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Android TV/Google TV, iOS mobile, and smart TVs. Apple TV, Samsung, and Vizio are also expected to join the list later in the year. It's worth noting that the apps are required to use the device — there's no HDMI output on the DVR itself.

Tablo

 The DVR supports wireless streaming of live and recorded TV to any screen within the home, including smart TVs, streaming devices, smartphones, and tablets via Wi-Fi or Ethernet. Tablo's mobile app will also help you set up both the antenna and Tablo device, optimizing reception and channel availability based on the home's proximity to broadcast towers.

 Nuvyyo CEO Grant Hall said in the announcement, “consumers struggling with inflation are looking for more affordable ways to enjoy live sports, local news and must-watch TV events.” He also went on to add that "with a live TV guide that spans the best in live broadcast TV and free live streaming content, one-touch series recording as well as customized content recommendations, Tablo has evolved beyond a way to enhance your antenna TV experience to an affordable portal to free TV without a subscription.”

 Sadly, there's no support for ATSC 3.0 (also known as "NextGen TV"), which would allow 4K channels and other features. DVR and tuner manufacturers are [still working on support](https://techidaily.com/solutions-to-restore-deleted-files-from-tecno-by-fonelab-android-recover-data/) for the DRM now in use on some ATSC 3.0 stations, and it seems like Tablo didn't want to put the launch on hold just for that. The FAQ on the product page explains, "The tuners in the 4th generation Tablo support the ATSC 1.0 broadcast standard used by all major commercial broadcasts today and the Tablo device takes full advantage of it like never before. While ATSC 3.0 broadcasts are available in some markets, ATSC 1.0 broadcasts will continue through at least June 2027."

 If this sounds like a cool addition to your home, [this new Tablo DVR](https://www.tablotv.com/product/?v=tablo) can be had for an MSRP of $129.95 with an antenna and $99.95 without one, although as of the time of writing, you can grab the antenna-equipped one for $109.95.
