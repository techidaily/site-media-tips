**Reasons You Shouldn't Download Untrusted Screen Recorder iOS APPs**

Thinking of a screen recorder iOS APP for iPhone? You're just not recommended to do so: For one thing, installing such APPs violates Apple's rules - who already yanked all screen recorders from shelf; For another, since you can only access them after jailbreak or through untrusted provider, you run the risk of virus.

To make things easier, capturing iPhone/iPad screen via Mac/PC Windows 10 enables easy editing once you finished recording, and exporting is just without hassle either by USB sync or AirDrop transmission.

To that end, you're just good to go with 5KPlayer - Fitting one-click iOS 13/12/11 screen recording, fix for [audio video out of sync](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/), and [AirPlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) into a lightweight built, 5KPlayer tops the list of today's recommendation as an iOS screen recorder. You can directly free download it:

**Price: $ 4.99**

Review - Vidyo is definitely a surprise when screen recorder iOS APPs became Apple Store's no-no. To tell the truth, Vidyo is easy-to-operate, multi-functional and overall stable in performance.

Just like 5KPlayer, it allows you to [record iPhone/iPad screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) by stimulating the [AirPlay Mirroring](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) function. Vidyo is able to capture video or audio from iPhone/iPad input, so you can record footage taken with the front/back camera, or record your own voice through the microphone.

But fitting all these into an iOS APP is dangerous, especially given the fact that Apple typically banned any iOS screen recorder APP. Likewise, Vidyo is on the chopping board and currently it's only available outside the APP store. However, today we have collected a quality source for **Vidyo screen recorder download**, which is given by the ipahub:https://ipahub.com/app.php?id=1067611079, that being said, you still have to be cautious before you download this officially yanked iOS screen recorder.

### Part 3: Quicktime Player - Free Screen Recorder iOS for Mac

**Price: Free**

Review - Recording iPhone/iPad screen was made possible by Apple together with the introduction of iOS 8 and OSX Yosemite - so this is a Mac-only utility if you want to record iPhone screen. Generally speaking, a pretty good free screen recorder except for audio and video out of sync in recordings now and then. If you're looking for one iOS screen recorder that also works for Windows, please look back to 5KPlayer.

How to Record - Just like any other Apple functionalities, record iPhone, iPad screen with Quicktime Player is handy and fast. You can: Connect iPhone and Mac with the lightning cable > Open Quicktime Player > File > New Movie Recording, when the recording window appear, click to get the drop-down menu, where you can select the name of your iPhone/iPad to record, Mic record is optional, which you can enable via the "Built-in Microphone: External Microphone" option.  
 When all is prepared, hit "Record" to start.

Problems - As you can notice, Quicktime Player is a Mac-only screen recorder iOS which relies on an USB cable. It really isn't bad for Mac users, but not so for Windows: The U.S. DOHS is urging Windows users to [uninstall Apple's QuickTime player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) immediately due to hacking dangers, that being said, please be cautious before you actually download.
