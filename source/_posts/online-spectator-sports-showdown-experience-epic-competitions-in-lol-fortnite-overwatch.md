### What is Esports?

Esports or eSports, standing for electronic sports, is a form of sport competition using video games and is the fastest-rising sport in the world as of now. Esports often takes the form of competitions between professional gamers (individually or as teams) from different leagues facing off the same games that are popular like Fortnite, Leagues of Lengends, Call of Duty, to just name a few. Often the case, the competitors are battling for a trophy and often huge prize money, that’s why more and more people want to be pro players. Though Esports streaming services like Twitch had provided information about Esports, you’d better know the difference between eSports and "Play Games" so as to grasp the essence of Esports and avoid of getting addicted to online games.

### Esports Live Streaming: Choose the Game Type

Esports games can be classified into two types: Against game and leisure game, but commonly the "Against" type is the eSports game that people are talking about. Among various types of games, the below six types are often played by gamers in eSports games.

**FPS game**, aka First-person shooter game, is a video game genre centered on gun and other weapon-based combat in a first-person perspective, that is, the gamer experiences the action through the eyes of the protagonist. Examples are Counter-Strike, Overwatch, Call of Duty, and the like.

**RTS game** is Real-time strategy game. It allows all players to simultaneously play the game in real time, while no need to take turns to play. In addition, players in the game can play the general and have deployment of troops. Examples include StarCraft and Warcraft.

**SPG** is tailor-made for sports enthusiasts who want sports to be entertained. All of this kind of games have the trend to move the sportsman’s true identity and information into the game so as to attract more gamers. Typical games are FIFA and NBA2K Series.

**FTG (Fight Technology Game)** is a kind of action game which has the obvious action game characteristics. The game is usually divided into two or more camps to fight each other, using fighting skills to defeat the opponent to win. The King of Fighters and Street Fighter can be categorized under this umbrella.

**MOBA game**: MOBA, also known as Action Real-Time Strategy (Action RTS or ARTS), is the abbreviation of Multiplayer online battle arena in which players usually need to buy equipment. To play the game, players are usually divided into two teams which will compete with each other in the scattered game map. Unlike the traditional hardcore RTS games, players do not need to operate RTS organizational units like buildings, resources, training arms, etc., but only control their chosen characters. The most popular MOBA games are Dota and LoL.

**CCG**: CCG is collectible card game, also called a trading card game, which is a type of card game that mixes strategic deck building elements with features of trading cards, introduced with Magic: The Gathering in 1993.

### Watch Esports Live: Top 9 Esports Events Deserving Streaming 2021

Esports events are usually held by different leagues, say The Overwatch League, The ESL Pro League, Call of Duty World League and the like, and every league has its own schedule for tournaments and matches of corresponding games once a year or more seasons a year. The games played in the eSports events are often FPS games, MOBA games and FTG games, and popular examples include StarCraft, Warcraft, Dota, CS:GO, League of Lengends, Storm Heroes, etc. An important or final game always attracts tens of thousands of people to watch, but disappointedly this year has no luck. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the Esports events had been cancelled. However, next year’s Esports live streaming deserves your attention.

### Top 3 Live Game Streaming Sites Where You Can Watch Esports Live

Actually, most of us don’t have the opportunity to have an in-person tournament. But if you want to familiarize yourself with eSports, the Esports live streaming sites are good places to go. Now that you have known something about the Esports events and popular eSports games, you can turn to below sites to watch Esports live whenever you want.

**No 1\. Twitch – Most Popular Platform to Live Stream Esports**

Twitch is the first live game streaming service which embraces the concept of live streaming how to play a game online. Including broadcasts of eSports competitions and gaming-related talk shows, this platform highlights Esports as a separate part. If you don’t know which games are popular or which one you should play, this place will help you make a decision. As for live game streaming, Twitch is the most active site which list live channels of different eSport games every day. You can watch how the professional gamers proceed their games and improve your own gaming skills, or just live streaming your own game if you like.

**No. 2 YouTube Gaming – Big Name, Big Reputation**

As Amazon-owned Twitch dominates the market and become a billion-dollar company because of live streaming game videos, YouTube is now getting on board to share the big cake. Though YouTube doesn’t highlight Esports as a standalone category, you can find Esports live gaming streaming channels in different kinds. YouTube Gaming channel is a game-centralized place where popular Esports streaming videos are provided and you can also broadcast your own. You don’t need to download any special app, if you have a YouTube account, then you already have everything you need. The disadvantage of this gamer-focused interface is that it is difficult to separate live contents from recorded contents.

![YouTube Gaming](https://www.5kplayer.com/live-streaming/img/youtube-gaming.jpg)

**Live games:** Garena Free Fire, Fortnite, Minecraft, Puzzle & Dragons, Among Us, CS: GO, PUBG MOBILE, Roblox, Dota 2, Brawl Stars, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Apex Legends, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege, Cooking Academy, Grand Theft Auto V, Call of Duty: Mobile, Saint Seiya: Awakening, NBA 2K21, Temple Run, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, League of Legends, Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Marvel’s Avengers, Lineage M, Dead by Daylight, Valorant, Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 2.

You can also search for other game videos that uploaded by gamers but they are not live videos. The Esports live streams are only included in the categories mentioned above, and obviously they are far less than that on Twitch website.

**No.3 Facebook Gaming – New but Promising**

Facebook allows users to live stream starting in 2015, and now it also dedicates its own separate game page. Fans can get notifications from their following accounts easily so as to track the popular game broadcastings in time. For broadcasters, Facebook Gaming now allows partnered streamers to play copyrighted music in the background of their live streams. Also, the migration of users from Mixer to Facebook Gaming gives you a good reason to live stream eSports games on this place. However, the speed of this platform is not as fast as Twitch when responses to network because it adopts .mpd form for live streams. Twitch adopts .m3u8 URL to live stream everything, and live m3u8 videos will change the resolution automatically and quickly to ensure smooth and high-quality streaming all the time. So, if you need a very quick response, Twitch is better.
