 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

Ever questioned about **how to watch 3D movies on your PC**? Did it ever occur to you that 3D films can be played on PC/Windows at home with you resting in sofa instead of going out to the cinema? If that's what you are thinking of, longing for a 3D home theater, some times you just need a simple and easy to use 3D movie player on your computers. 

### 3D Technology Display Brief Intro Before Playing 3D Movies on PC

To address how to play 3D movies on computer, gaining a little knowledge of 3D tech is necessary. Nowadays, there are mainly 5 commonly used formats for 3D film displaying: Anaglyph, Polarization systems, Eclipse method, Interference filter technology, and Autostereoscopy, and the former two are the most used technologies to watch 3D movies and are the closest to us 3D viewers. 

To play 3D films on Windows PC is different from what cinemas and TVs are doing. Cinemas and modern 3D TVs provide polarized 3D films to watch. But for PC, Laptop, Tablet etc. with normal displays (LCD), Anaglyph 3D, the earliest and easiest method of presenting 3D movies in theater, is applied. Therefore, the easiest solution to how to watch a 3D film on PC/Windows would be:   
1) wearing a pair of Anaglyph 3D glasses, which employ filters of different colors (red and cyan) to encode 3D images;  
 and 2) finding the best media player to play 3D videos on your computer. 

### Best Method to Play 3D Movies on PC

**\*Get a pair of 3D Glasses for watching 3D videos on PC**:  
 Commonly, there are basically three types of 3D glasses for you to watch 3D films: passive galsses- red/cyan galsses & polarized glasses, and active shutter glasses. Polarized glasses are for cinemas and 3D TVs whilst active shutter glasses are designed for specific 3D TVs.  
 To watch 3D videos on Windows PC with normal display (LCD), a pair of 3D Anaglyph glasses, i.e. the Red/Cyan glasses, is required. You can buy those glasses online from eBay, Amazon or other shopping sites for just a couple of bucks.
