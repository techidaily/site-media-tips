For free streaming TV shows and Sports Games, you may have searched the whole internet to get a solution and finds them distressful. Here in this article, we provide 4 best ways for your free steaming TV shows enjoyment. 

## What are the Recommended Top 4 Online TV Streaming Services

### Streaming TV with 5KPlayer: All Time Free

5KPlayer ushers a unique way of free steaming TV shows by combining download and [Airplay function](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/). It offers fully tested 300+ online websites for you to get free TV shows downloaded and steamed to your big HDTV. With those great online websites, you can download HBO Westworld, House of Cards, Game of Thrones… and then free stream them to your PC/Mac and HDTV to achieve free streaming TV shows and sports game.

5KPlayer this time lets you totally own the TV shows and stream them everywhere at anytime you want. It bolsters its versatile capability by also supporting almost all file formats MKV, AVI, MOV, MP4, FLV, WMV, etc. with HD and UHD 4K/5K/8K quality for TV streaming.

### Streaming TV with Netflix: One Month Free

Netflix would be the staple TV streaming service you should get if you really consider killing off the cable. It provides the on-demand Internet streaming TV shows, always in "super HD" to North/South America, Australia, New Zealand, America and parts of Europe, mainly concerning TV dramas rather than movies that are frequently added and removed. Smart TVs and TV streaming boxes are mostly embedded with Netflix app (very universally applied), which is easy to get and handy to use.

However, Netflix falls short in its content restriction. Unlimited TV streaming will cost you extra $8.99 per month. Also, Netflix won’t allow you to download any TV shows.

### Streaming TV with Hulu and Hulu Plus: One Week Free

With Hulu and Hulu Plus, you can "watch full seasons of the best TV shows on all your devices with limited advertising". Hulu is indeed one of the greatest places to watch movies and TV streaming on the internet free. The website is owned by NBC, FOX, and ABC and offers TV shows from those networks and others including TBS, A&E, AMC. They typically add new episodes of the shows the next day. If you have a Hulu+ membership, you get access to entire seasons for TV streaming and quicker release dates.

However, slow and choppy playback is inevitable with Hulu and Hulu Plus while streaming TV shows and sports games like the Century Fight between Mayweather and Pacquiao and their predicted next fight in Sept. Sometimes the quality gets even worse with black player window and no functioning. All these TV streaming problems can happen to your TV, Roku, iPad and Android devices.

### Streaming TV with Sling TV: 7 Days Free

With Sling TV, you can easily take back TV. The most shining point of Sling TV is its live TV streaming feature, live streaming TV shows and live sports games from tons of channels including ESPN, ESPN2, AMC, TNT, TBS, Travel Channel, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, CNN, etc. for just $20 a month, while adding HBO for only $15 a month more. It is really worth the net savings of about 80/month cutting the cable.

Sling TV is sadly only available in USA, and some of you may find watching the NCAA basketball on Sling TV live streaming very painful since the picture becomes so blocky that you can't even read the players numbers or the score banner, and worst still, video stops requiring you to re-entry and wait for re-boot. 

From above list, the one-month-free fee-based Netflix is of course a great choice for budget-minded TV shows connoisseurs that are about to cut the TV cord. But if you stick to your TV cord and do not want to cost a dime to get free streaming TV shows from online anywhere at any time, then 5KPlayer will serve you well as a second-to-none choice.
