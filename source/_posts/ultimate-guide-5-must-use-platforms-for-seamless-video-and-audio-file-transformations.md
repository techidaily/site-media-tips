 Hero5 Session is always recommended by professionals when it comes to the top-ended action camera. It has many impressive features and cheaper prices comparing with GoPro Hero5 Black. It is waterproof, and turns on & records with a single button press. Users can enjoy recording with 4K footage at 30fps and 1080p at 90fps. The built in GPS device will help you to get complete location based details on your tour. Although it doesn't come with touch screen, it can be controlled with voice commands.

### 3\. GoPro HERO4 Black

![GoPro Hero4 Black](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/resource/gopro-camera/gopro-hero4-black.jpg)

 HERO4 is no longer available through GoPro, but it still can be found on Amazon, Best Buy or other places. This is the best camera GoPro made before Hero5\. It offers excellent quality video, including at 4K up to 30fps. It doesn't have a built-in touch display but it is still compatible with the Karma drone. You can also get it in Surf (includes mounts for your surfboard) and Music (includes mounts made for music) editions.

 GoPro HERO4 has really achieved a balance of features and performance. Technically, the Silver can record 4K, but at a maximum of 15fps it isn't a mode we imagine anyone wanting to use. It looks a lot like the Hero Session, has built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Better than Hero4 Black which has a LED but no touchscreen, Sliver has both.

### 5\. GoPro Hero Session

![GoPro Hero Session](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/resource/gopro-camera/gopro-hero-session.jpg)

 Hero Session was the lightest and smallest GoPro camera when it was firstly launched in July 2015\. On account of that, it is still popular when you are mounting somewhere other cameras can't fit. The HERO Session video is exactly like the HERO5 Session in design, and is also waterproof to 10m without any housing required. It shoots up to Full HD 1080p resolution video and 8MP still images. All in all, it's sleek, compact, and user friendly.
