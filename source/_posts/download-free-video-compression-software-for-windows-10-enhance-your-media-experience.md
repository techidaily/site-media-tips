The codec-related problem needs codec download to solve, so this place provides delicately-selected codecs for Windows 10 to help you play all video formats successfully.

**Video Codec Windows 10 Download is Necessary for Windows Media Player on Windows 10**

When you need to download codecs for Windows 10, I guess your Windows Media Player on Windows 10 would have received an error message like _"A codec is required to play this file", "Windows Media Player encountered an error", "Windows Media Player cannot play the file because the required video codec is not installed on your computer.", or "Invalid file format"_. Actually, the default [Windows 10 media player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) \- Windows Media Player doesn't include the codecs for FLAC files, FLV files and more. Besides, it doesn't play the most common MP4 and MKV files very successfully when these media files are encoded with H.264, H.265 or any other incompatible codecs.

### Disadvantages of Windows 10 Video Codec Pack

These codec packs indeed help beef up your Windows Media Player to play multimedia files without troubles, but they are actually not that satisfying.

Secondly, the newly downloaded Windows 10 codec pack may **conflict with the existed codecs** on your PC.
