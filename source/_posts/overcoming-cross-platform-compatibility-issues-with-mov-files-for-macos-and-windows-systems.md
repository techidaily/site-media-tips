## Possible 3 Reasons to MOV Won't Play Problem:

• **Player software not supporting codecs contained in MOV**: some players like QuickTime only supports MOV file encoded with MPEG-4 or H.264 video and AAC audio. If a H265 codec is contained, the player won't open MOV as a result. Therefore, QuickTime won't play MOV can be easily understood. In this case, one can simply convert the video codec into general supported h.264 ACC or install additional codec packs or just change a media player instead. Usually problems like .mov won't play in VLC, won't play on PC Windows, won't play on Mac iPhone Android can be categorized under this major reason.
