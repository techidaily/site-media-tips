## Meet the Multifaceted Media Marvel: Google's Cutting-Edge Streamer Doubles as a Savvy Smart Hub for Your Living Space

Google has now released the Google TV Streamer, the company’s first attempt in years to make a higher-end TV streaming box. It has 4K support, some smart home integrations, and all the apps you’d expect on a Google TV or Android TV device.

 The Google TV Streamer is a small box intended to sit next to your TV, as opposed to the older Google Chromecast models, which could be hidden behind the TV and powered with the TV’s own USB port. It supports 4K, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision output, as well as Dolby Atmos and Dolby Digital Plus audio.

 The box runs the same [Google TV software (formerly Android TV)](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/wondering-the-best-alternative-to-hola-on-apple-iphone-6s-plus-here-is-the-answer-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/) as the Chromecast with Google TV, giving you access to TV-optimized apps from the Google Play Store, the ability to Cast content from supported apps on a phone or tablet, and deep integration with Google Home and Nest devices. It can also act as a [Matter smart home hub](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-solo-podcast-production-for-top-spots/) and Thread border router.

 Google said in a blog post, “Streaming has boomed in popularity, meaning more options for what to watch than ever before. Google TV Streamer offers access to 700,000+ movies and shows through streaming apps like YouTube TV, Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV and more, in addition to live TV with 800+ free channels.”

 This is the first time Google has released a full-size streaming box since the [Nexus Player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus%5FPlayer) in 2014\. There haven’t been many other options for a higher-end Android TV or Google TV streaming player, with [Walmart’s Onn-brand devices](https://android-frp.techidaily.com/full-guide-to-bypass-oppo-a2-frp-by-drfone-android/) being the most popular alternative to the aging [NVIDIA Shield TV](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/boosting-patient-engagement-through-fb-health-ads/).

 The Google TV Streamer has 32GB of internal storage and 4GB RAM, which is a much-needed upgrade from the miniscule 8GB storage on the earlier Chromecast with Google TV—complaints about having to uninstall apps to make room for new apps and system updates were frequent. Google didn’t mention which chipset it’s using, but _Android Authority_ reports it has a MediaTek MT8696, the same chip used by the 2021 Amazon Fire TV Stick Max.

 The built-in Ethernet LAN port is another much-needed upgrade, as all Chromecast models required a [power adapter](https://store.google.com/us/product/chromecast%5Fethernet%5Fadapter%5Fgen%5F2) or USB hub to use a wired internet connection. There’s still Wi-Fi as well, but it’s only Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac), not the newer Wi-Fi 6, 6E, or 7 protocols. The box also has a USB Type-C port for power and HDMI 2.1 for video output.

 Google didn’t change the remote much compared to the Chromecast with Google TV. It has the same rounded design with a circular pad at the top, but if you lose the remote, you can now press a button on the back of the Google TV Streamer to make it ring.

 You can [pre-order the Google TV Streamer](https://store.google.com/product/google%5Ftv%5Fstreamer?hl=en-US) for $100 from the Google Store, and it’s also [available at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-tv-streamer-4k-porcelain%2F6586840.p%3FskuId%3D6586840).
