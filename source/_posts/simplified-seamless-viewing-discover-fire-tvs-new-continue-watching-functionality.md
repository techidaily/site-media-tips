## Simplified Seamless Viewing: Discover Fire TV's New Continue Watching Functionality

Picking up where you left off on most streaming services is pretty straightforward. A lot of the time, you'll have a row where you can just select the episode of the show or movie you're watching. However, that requires opening the app first, which can take a few clicks, and remembering which service you were using for which show. Amazon is attempting to streamline that process with a new "Continue Watching" option on Fire TV devices.

 The home screen of your Amazon Fire TV will now have a "Continue Watching" option. This section of the home screen will be identical to the section that you can currently see on individual streaming services such as Netflix, Prime Video, and Disney+, and it's exactly what you think it is. If you've been watching anything, this is a shortcut that will let you pick up right where you left offâ€”clicking on an item in the list will open your streaming service of choice, right on the video where you left off. If you just finished an episode of a series, the section will show you the next episode, if there is one. If you left a movie or episode right in the middle, it'll start right back up at that same moment.

 It's basically the same menu as the menu you can currently find inside your favorite streaming services, except that it'll encompass multiple apps. At the moment, it will show movies and shows from Max, STARZ, MGM+, Prime Video, and Amazon Freevee. Amazon might choose to partner with other streaming services down the road in order to improve this feature even further, but at the moment, aside from the services we just mentioned, you shouldn't expect to have your incomplete shows and movies from services such as Netflix or Disney+ show up there. For now, the company has confirmed that the functionality is coming for services such as Peacock and Tubi.

 If you want to check it out, make sure that your Fire TV device is fully updated, and also, make sure that you're subscribed to services that are eligible for this.
