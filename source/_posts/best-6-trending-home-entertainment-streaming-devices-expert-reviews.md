#### **No.4 Amazon Fire TV (4K UHD Support Available)**

**Device Price:**$89.99  
**Operating System:** Android  
**Built-in Applications:** Over 10,000 apps available.  
**Remote Control:** Yes, with an extra Alexa Voice Remote.   
**Video Streaming Quality:** Up to 4K UHD

**Review**The classical Amazon Fire TV, with upgraded features than the $39.99 Fire TV Stick, virtually offers more stable streaming performance, and a sweet uplift to play 4K Ultra HD content. This digital player leaves a blank microSD slot in case you're thinking of expanding storage in the future, and it also leaves Bluetooth connectivity for Fire TV Game Controller if you're thinking of upgrading the equipment.   
**Tip:** Fire TV only connects to TV sets that support HDCP requirement, and you're suggested to check out the specs to see if it matches up with your TV.

#### **No.5 Roku Streaming Stick 3rd-Generation**

**Device Price:**$49.99  
**Built-in Applications:** Access the entire Google Play Store, Amazon Underground   
**Remote Control:** Yes   
**Video Streaming Quality:** Up to 1080p

**Review:**Throughout Roku's complete lineup of digital media players we've come to this 2016 new member - Roku Streaming Stick 3rd-gen, a cost-effective choice if you don't have a 4K TV display.  
Dongle or set-top box? Most customers come to this puzzle when first started to choose a digital media player, in that dongles virtually works less reliably than a robust smart TV box. But truth is Roku 3 works just as well as any streaming devices.

#### **No.6 SkyStream One Streaming Media Player**

**Device Price:**$149.99  
**Operating System:** Android  
**Built-in Applications:** Access the entire Google Play Store, Amazon Underground   
**Remote Control:** Yes   
**Video Streaming Quality:** Up to 4K UHD

**Review:**This brand-new gadget that only hit the shelf on February 2021 seems an inspiring and integrated solution for cord-cutters! The all-in support for Google Player Store and Amazon Underground excites us - honestly the largest profile among all digital media players available out there in the market, which means you can not only download Netflix, Hulu, HBO and Amazon Video for standard free online streaming, but also match up the extender with your existing cable service like WatchESPN, HBO GO, etc associated with the paid cable account. Developed by the XBMV/KODI team, SkyStream One is indeed a nice option for entertainment.
