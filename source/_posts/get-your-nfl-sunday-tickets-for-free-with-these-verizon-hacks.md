##  What is the NFL Sunday Ticket?

 Any football fan should know what the NFL Sunday Ticket has to offer. If not, you're in for a treat. Instead of only being able to watch one or two of the games in your local area, the Sunday Ticket lets you watch every live (out-of-market) game on Sunday. Better yet, you can watch more than one game at the same time.

 The Sunday Ticket was an option from DirecTV for almost 30 years, but now it's distributed by [YouTube and YouTube TV](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-check-if-your-nokia-g22-is-unlocked-by-drfone-android/). You can stream games from TVs, phones, laptops, and tablets. YouTube even has a [neat multi-view mode](https://some-tips.techidaily.com/new-unlock-vivid-visuals-windows-hdplus-guide-to-hdr-mastery/) where you can simultaneously put four NFL games on one screen. The Ticket costs an eye-watering $449, or those who already subscribe to YouTube TV only pay $350\. This way, it's free.

 By subscribing to the NFL Sunday Ticket, you can watch all the matchups. This is great for a Packers fan like myself who lives in Texas. I can watch my team instead of the Cowboys or Texans. As a reminder, the NFL Sunday ticket on YouTube includes unlimited in-home streams, along with two outside the home, like on your phone.

_[YouTube](https://tv.youtube.com/learn/nflsundayticket/)_

 Verizon will [give you the NFL Sunday Ticket on them](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2005029/https://www.verizon.com/support/nfl-st-on-us-promo-legal/), but you'll have to join a qualifying phone or Verizon Fios internet plan first. This is available to new and current customers, and you do not need a YouTube TV subscription, either. Here's how to qualify:

* **New Mobile Plan Purchase**: Customers who set up a cellular [Unlimited plan](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2005029/https://www.verizon.com/plans/unlimited/) and purchase a qualifying smartphone get a season of the NFL Sunday Ticket for free.
* **New Home Internet Plan**: New and existing customers who sign up for a qualifying [Verizon Home Internet](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2005029/https://www.verizon.com/home/internet/) plan get a season of the NFL Sunday Ticket free.
* **Device Upgrade**: Existing customers who purchase a qualifying device on an Unlimited Plus plan will secure a free season of NFL Sunday Ticket.
* **For Customers Who Don't Want to Upgrade**: Existing Verizon customers who don't upgrade can still [save $100](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2005029/https://www.verizon.com/support/nfl-st-on-us-promo-legal/) on the Sunday Ticket.

 Suppose you already have a Verizon Wireless Unlimited Plus or Ultimate plan. In that case, you can still get the NFL Sunday Ticket for free by adding a new line and buying a qualifying smartphone. If you don't want to buy a new phone or change plans, Verizon will still give you a $100 discount on the Sunday ticket.

 Those who opt for Verizon's home internet must choose a qualifying plan, which is to upgrade to a Verizon Fios with gigabit speeds for $90 per month. The promo also applies to Verizon Home 5G Home Plus internet plans that start at $70 per month. Here's some of the fine print provided by Verizon:

_"After selecting the NFL Sunday Ticket from YouTube, On Us offer through your My Verizon account, you will be prompted to sign in with Google. You will then be prompted to activate the offer through YouTube. You must activate the offer within 60 days of the order/activation or no later than 12/10/24\. Otherwise, the subscription will be canceled."_ 

 Additionally, customers must keep these new wireless/home internet plans in good standing and fully paid through February 2025, or Verizon reserves the right to charge you for the NFL Sunday Ticket. Basically, you can't get the freebie and then cancel your new home internet plan.

##  You Don't Need a YouTube TV Subscription

 This is similar to the NFL Sunday Ticket promo Verizon ran [last year](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/slicephoto-inspection/). It's important to note that you don't have to have a YouTube TV subscription to take advantage of the NFL Sunday Ticket. Why? You can watch every NFL game through [YouTube Primetime Channels](https://www.androidpolice.com/what-are-youtube-primetime-channels/) inside the YouTube app or on the web.

 However, you will need to either already have a Google (Gmail) account or sign up for a Google account to access your content through YouTube.

 So, upgrade your phone or home internet plan today, get the NFL Sunday Ticket for free from Verizon, and enjoy endless football every Sunday during the 2024-25 season. Don't forget your favorite jersey and cold beverages, and invite all your friends over to watch the big game.
