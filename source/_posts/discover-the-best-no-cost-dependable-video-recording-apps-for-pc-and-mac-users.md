"I was wondering if anyone was able to figure out how to open .dvr extension format or files? Tried Windows Media Player, Windows Player Classic, VLC, Quicktime; none of them work…" Since many users are encountering the same DVR playback failure on Windows/Mac, and want to find a genuine **DVR player** that supports playback of .dvr format, we listed out 5 most trustworthy DVR file player software based on test.

**2\. Open Source DVR Recorder Player – Kodi (XBMC)**

As it is known to all, Kodi features powerful Live TV and video recording (DVR/PVR) abilities. It enables you to watch & record live TV, DIY Whole Home DVR, automated DVR from the GUI interface and thus play back those recordings correspondingly. It's a combination of DVR recorder and DVR file player that might cover more thoroughly in terms of DVR codec support.

**3\. Light Weight DVR Player to Handle Large Files – Daum PotPlayer**

PotPlayer supports DVR/DVR-MS and also deals with MOV, MKV, AVI, DVR files as large as 1.6GB flawlessly, very stable performance with a plenty of supported A/V formats as well as inbuilt subtitle support for .ass and .srt. So, if the DVR video is too large, PotPlayer should be your first choice.

**4\. Smart DVR Player to deal with Locked/Incomplete Files – GOM player**

The reason you may want to give this DVR file player software a shot is its competence of playback damaged/incomplete/locked/partially downloaded DVR files. You can use GOM player to test if it is the problem of DVR file quality itself that causes the DVR playback failure. 

  
**5\. Codec free DVR player – SMPlayer**

This DVR player software is totally free from codec restrictions and provides a pile of subtitle control. The only drawback of this player is its playback for WMV file protected by DRM, which won't take you anywhere near a smooth enjoyment with WMV.

#### **Possible Reasons to DVR Playback Failure**

Before jumping into the bandwagon of DVR players for Windows 7/10/Mac, you should learn some basics about DVR and why some of it cannot be played via third-party software.

DVR/DVR-MS isn't so much a common video format as a proprietary format. Some of the DVR-MS videos are strictly copy protected by its content owner/manufacturer to ensure tamperproof like CCTV surveillance footage or [Netflix movie](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/) recordings, and thus are inherent not accessible on all accounts without authorization. Therefore, it is necessary that you find out the source of the DVR file and apply directly for the right to access DVR contents.
