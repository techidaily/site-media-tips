## Immerse in the World of Tamriel with Instant Skyrim Gameplay on GeForce Now Platform.

Hey, NVIDIA is finally awake. The GeForce NOW cloud gaming service just added 'The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim' to its collection of supported games.

 Titles developed by Bethesda, including Skyrim, were a staple of GeForce NOW during the cloud gaming platform's beta testing period. But when NVIDIA asked Bethesda to opt in after GeForce NOW's official launch, the studio refused. This came as no surprise—Bethesda had been [acquired by Xbox](https://www.denofgeek.com/games/xbox-buys-bethesda-elder-scrolls-skyrim-fallout-doom-starfield/), NVIDIA's rival in the cloud gaming space.

 During its acquisition of Bethesda and other game studios, Microsoft repeatedly stated that such acquisitions were intended to bolster the number of Xbox-exclusive games. This led to [antitrust complaints](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/2210077-microsoftactivision-blizzard-matter) from the FTC. So, Microsoft is now taking a more generous approach to game distribution, and GeForce NOW is a benefactor.

 Both the original version of Skyrim and its 2016 Special Edition re-release are supported on GeForce Now. If you've got one of these games in your Steam or Epic library, you don't need to buy Skyrim again—simply link your Steam or Epic account to GeForce NOW. Those who only own the 2021 Anniversary Edition aren't so lucky. The 2021 re-release isn't supported by GeForce NOW. So, a handful of gamers get to enjoy the great tradition of buying Skyrim for a second, or third, or fourth, or fifth time.

 Seven other games have also been added to GeForce NOW. These games include Cataclismo, CONSCRIPT, F1 Manager 2024, EARTH DEFENSE FOURCE 6, Gang Beasts, Kingdoms and Castles, and Settlers: New Allies. I'd like to give a quick shoutout to all the EDF fans in the crowd.

 Premium versions of GeForce NOW [are 50% off](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-financials-of-boosting-your-youtube-videos/) through August 18th. If you're an active cloud gamer, I suggest signing up for a six-month subscription, which will cost you as little as $25 during this sale.
