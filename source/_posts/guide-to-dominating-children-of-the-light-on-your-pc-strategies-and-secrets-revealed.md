I also downloaded this game on my iPhone and explored one chapter already. I have to say I love it and I hope it can have a Windows version. But based on the fact that the game is only available for iOS and Android at present, I have to use a different way. 5KPlayer, an [iOS game to PC mirroring](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) software, satisfies my curiosity about how it performs when playing Sky: Children of the Light on Windows PC. If you also want a try, just follow my step-by-step guide.

**Tips!**

You may have found there is another way suggested to help you download and play Sky: Children of the Light game on PC, that is installing iOS emulator to create a virtual iOS system on PC. It is indeed an option if there is no other choices. However, you should be told that the way has a complicated installation process, requires payment for premium version and sometimes may bring adware or malware to your computer.
