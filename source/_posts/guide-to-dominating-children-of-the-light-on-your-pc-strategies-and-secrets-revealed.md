I also downloaded this game on my iPhone and explored one chapter already. I have to say I love it and I hope it can have a Windows version. But based on the fact that the game is only available for iOS and Android at present, I have to use a different way. 5KPlayer, an [iOS game to PC mirroring](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) software, satisfies my curiosity about how it performs when playing Sky: Children of the Light on Windows PC. If you also want a try, just follow my step-by-step guide.

**Tips!**
