 Twitch has teamed up with Apple in its latest promotion to offer viewers three months of Apple TV+ for as little as $5.99\. In comparison, Apple typically offers its streaming service featuring Apple Original shows and movies for $9.99 each month. Here's how to get it.

##  How to Redeem This Limited-Time Offer

 For those unfamiliar with [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/), it is a live-streaming service with a primary focus on video games. Each user profile on Twitch is referred to as a "Channel." Once a Channel joins Twitch’s affiliate program for streamers, monetization tools like viewer subscriptions become available.

 To get three months of [Apple TV+](https://www.apple.com/apple-tv-plus/) through Twitch, all you have to do is subscribe to or gift someone a subscription to any Twitch Channel before August 19th, 2024, at 12:00 PM PT. Tier 1 subscriptions are $5.99 a month and will only renew if you choose the 3- or 6-month options. At the time of writing, multi-month subscriptions are $5.39/month and $5.09/month, respectively.

 As with any promotion too good to pass up, terms and conditions apply. To qualify, you must be a new or eligible returning Apple TV+ subscriber with an Apple ID that has a payment method on file. Anyone with an active Apple TV+ subscription will be ineligible for this deal. Similarly, while resubscribing to a Twitch channel qualifies, active recurring subscriptions and Prime subscriptions are excluded.

##  How to Subscribe to Twitch Channels

 Subscribing to a Twitch channel is a fairly straightforward process. First, navigate to the channel you want to subscribe to. This can be done by searching for the username in Twitch’s search bar at the top of the page. Channels you already follow will show up in the “For You” menu on the left side of the page, as well as on the “Following” page.

 Once you select the channel you plan to subscribe to, you’ll either be directed to their live stream or their offline channel. In both cases, the “Gift a Sub” and “Subscribe” buttons can be found side by side under the right side of the broadcasting screen.

Close 

 Clicking the “Gift a Sub” button allows you to customize the subscription tier and theme, give to a specific person if desired, or choose the number of subscriptions to gift to the community. The “Subscribe” button is where you’ll find a list of all the goodies to be received with your subscription, such as exclusive emotes and ad-free viewing. You’ll also be able to customize the tier and length of your subscription prior to confirming.

Close 

 After choosing your gift or subscription options, you’ll be prompted to enter your payment details to finalize payment. Once complete, a code will be sent to your Twitch notifications inbox and will be available on the [Drops & Rewards Inventory](http://www.twitch.tv/drops/inventory) page. Use that code for redemption on the [Apple TV+ redemption site](http://apps.apple.com/redeem/). You must use the code before August 31 at 11:59 PM PT.
