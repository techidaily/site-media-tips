**Reasons You Shouldn't Download Untrusted Screen Recorder iOS APPs**

Thinking of a screen recorder iOS APP for iPhone? You're just not recommended to do so: For one thing, installing such APPs violates Apple's rules - who already yanked all screen recorders from shelf; For another, since you can only access them after jailbreak or through untrusted provider, you run the risk of virus.

To make things easier, capturing iPhone/iPad screen via Mac/PC Windows 10 enables easy editing once you finished recording, and exporting is just without hassle either by USB sync or AirDrop transmission.

To that end, you're just good to go with 5KPlayer - Fitting one-click iOS 13/12/11 screen recording, fix for [audio video out of sync](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/), and [AirPlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) into a lightweight built, 5KPlayer tops the list of today's recommendation as an iOS screen recorder. You can directly free download it:

### Part 2: Vidyo - Paid Screen Recorder iOS APP (Download Cautiously)

![Vidyo iphone screen recorder](https://www.5kplayer.com/airplay/img/viduo-recorder.jpg)

**Price: $ 4.99**

Review - Vidyo is definitely a surprise when screen recorder iOS APPs became Apple Store's no-no. To tell the truth, Vidyo is easy-to-operate, multi-functional and overall stable in performance.

Just like 5KPlayer, it allows you to [record iPhone/iPad screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) by stimulating the [AirPlay Mirroring](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) function. Vidyo is able to capture video or audio from iPhone/iPad input, so you can record footage taken with the front/back camera, or record your own voice through the microphone.

But fitting all these into an iOS APP is dangerous, especially given the fact that Apple typically banned any iOS screen recorder APP. Likewise, Vidyo is on the chopping board and currently it's only available outside the APP store. However, today we have collected a quality source for **Vidyo screen recorder download**, which is given by the ipahub:https://ipahub.com/app.php?id=1067611079, that being said, you still have to be cautious before you download this officially yanked iOS screen recorder.
