## Part 1\. How to Save a GIF from Twitter/X on Your Desktop

 When you see a GIF, you want to download on Twitter/X, you may right-click on it and look for the Save GIF option by force of habit. When you do that, you will only get the Copy GIF Address option. Twitter does not give a direct download button. So, you have to rely on some related Twitter downloading websites or browser extensions.

### Download GIFs from Twitter with Online Tools

 Many free online Twitter video downloaders and URL-to-GIF converters claim to easily save Twitter GIFs. However, some of them can’t analyze Twitter GIFs. You should select a reputable and really working one like Imgflip Animated GIF Maker. It can generate animated GIFs from Twitter, GIPHY, YouTube, and many other websites.

 There are many other online Twitter GIF downloading tools offered on the market. Popular ones include Twitter Video Downloader, Ezgif, and Convertio URL to GIF. However, through my tests, they may fail to analyze the Twitter GIF you want to save.

 You can also choose to install a browser extension specifically designed for downloading Twitter GIFs. Open your web browser and go to the extension store. When you get there, search for Twitter GIF downloader or similar keywords to locate them.
