 Do you hate the awkward silence between songs in your Apple Music playlist? You can fix that with the crossfade feature, which smoothly blends one song into the next for a continuous listening experience, and it's available for iPhone, iPad, Android, Mac, and Windows.

##  How to Enable the Crossfade Feature in Apple Music on Your iPhone or iPad

 To enable crossfade on an iPhone or iPad, go to Settings > Music > Crossfade. This feature was [introduced in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/assessing-data-protection-risks-in-using-chatgpt-technology/), and it blends tracks with a smooth fade transition. After enabling this feature, you'll see that as the current song nears its end, it slowly fades out while the next one gradually fades in, creating a perfectly continuous listening experience.

 To enable the crossfade feature in Apple Music on your iPhone or iPad, open the "Settings" app and tap "Music."

 And that's about it. You can now play the Apple Music app on your iPhone or iPad and experience the smooth transition between songs caused by the crossfade feature.

##  How to Enable the Crossfade Feature in Apple Music on Your Android Device
