## Confused About Which Movie or Show to Binge Next? Let Us Help You Decide!

### Key Takeaways

* Reelgood Roulette helps you find movies and TV shows among endless streaming services.
* Customize preferences for streaming services, genre, and ratings to tailor the recommendations.
* Conveniently jump to the chosen title directly on the streaming service to start watching.

 With the number of streaming services available today, you'd think it'd be easy to find something to watch. But when you don't have a specific movie or TV show in mind, you can end up aimlessly scrolling through lists of titles on multiple apps. Stop wasting time and try Reelgood Roulette.

 The problem is streaming services just have so much content to sift through. Even a service with a [relatively small library](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-iphone-6s-online-here-are-6-easy-ways-by-drfone-ios/), such as Peacock, probably has more titles than you would have found in a Blockbuster back in the day. It doesn't help that many of these titles are [low-rated fillers to pump up the numbers](https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/eaders-in-learning-select-sci-yt-channels/). So, finding a movie or TV show that piques your interest can be a challenge.

##  Spin the Roulette Wheel

 This is where Reelgood Roulette comes in. Reelgood is a web service that makes it easy to find where to watch pretty much anything online. The Roulette feature randomly picks a movie or TV show for you to watch, but it doesn't have to be _completely_ random. You can choose your streaming services, a genre, and exclude titles with ratings under a threshold.

 First, visit [reelgood.com/roulette](https://reelgood.com/roulette) in a web browser on your phone, tablet, or computer. You'll want to select all the streaming services you're subscribed to. In this example, we'll be using Netflix, but you can choose one or more.

Close 

 You may be asked to sign in or create an account, but that's not necessary to use the Roulette feature. Just select "Skip."

 You don't have to change any of these next settings if you don't want to, but it does help. Narrow down the selections by genre, TV show or movie, and ratings. Select "Spin" when you're done.

 A result will pop up underneath the "Spin" buttonâ€”select "Watch Now" to jump straight to the streaming service. Of course, if you're looking to watch it on a smart TV, you'll need to open the streaming app and search for it manually.

 Reelgood Roulette is a pretty effective way to quickly get suggestions for movies and TV shows that are actually available to watch on your services. Will the first result be something you want to watch? Probably not. But there's no harm in hitting the "Spin Again" button until you do.
