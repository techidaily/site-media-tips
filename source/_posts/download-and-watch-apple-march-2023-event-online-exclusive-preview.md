##  Apple March Event 2023 Rumors Roundup

With Buzzfeed's John Paczkowski first confirming the event date, 9to5mac seems to be scoring the most details on Apple's new iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch band. Let's jump right in to see how the iPhone lineup's going to shuffle in this spring event.  

![iPhone 7 Red](https://www.5kplayer.com/airplay/img/red-iphone-7.jpg) 

### 1\. Red iPhone 7/iPhone 7 Plus

4.0-inch flexible size, a bump-up from A8X to A9X processor into an entry-level slot, iPhone SE arrives just in time to juice sales of iPhone since its one-way expansion to 4.7-inch and 5.5 inch. As the first iPhone model to be release during Apple's March Event (previous sets unveiled in September event usually), iPhone SE is a dubbed nostalgic model for Apple users who prefer a palm-size gadget. Pricing starts from $399 of 16 GB to $499 of a 64 GB, making it the "most affordable iPhone ever" to easily take the place of the $450 iPhone 5s.   
 iPhone SE or iPhone 7? Read this [AirPlay iPhone 7](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) forcast for rumors on iPhone 7(Plus), or a direct comparison of [iPhone SE vs iPhone 7](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

### 2\. 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 New Models

iPad Pro seems to be at the teeth of the storm before Apple's March Event live 2023, with Feburary news suggesting it would be 4 new models including a 12.9\. 10.9, 9.7 and 7.5-inch iPad Pro available. It finally turned out that this time users are embracing only one 9.7-inch iPad, with the price starting from $329 of a 32 GB model to a Wi-Fi+Cellular model at $459 available for booking from March 24\. It's interesting to look into Apple's re-positioning strategy implied from the iPad Pro mini instead of iPad Air 3 - with 12.7-inch iPad Pro hitting shelves last fall, iPad Pro shipped with Apple Pencil and a smart keyword is more business-oriented as opposed to iPad mini 4, take a look at this iPad Pro 2 compare This mini module may well be wrapped up by a 12-megapixel back camera and the ability to record 4K videos, just like iPhone 6s/6s Plus.

### 3\. Apple Watch New Accessories (No New Updates)

2023's Apple March Event marks the two-year-birthday of the only wearable Apple product, dishing out are woven Nylon Watch band of a full category of 7 colors, and the price - $299 remains the same as the previous Sport Band. It's been a fruitful year for this little gadget as Apple iWatch rises as the 2nd best smartwatch seller during 2015 Q4.

 However, the expected Apple Watch 2 release date is quite likely to be pushed off till 2023 fall rather than Apple's March 21 Event. But this sounds rather a good news to all in the light of a massive feedback of Apple Watch users claiming they'd prefer an Apple Watch 2 to go independently of iPhone, espacially when [Apple Watch AirPlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) wasn't working alone independently.

### 4\. New Macbook Air/Pro (No New Models)

Another product rumored, but might not be in the pipeline of Apple March Event is the Macbook Air and Macbook Pro, which were updated in March and May of 2015 respectively. Despite the fact that Apple launches its new laptop model in every March of a year, there seem sign of a new upgrade in the release this month.  
[Rumors from macworld.co.uk](http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/mac/2016-macbook-pro-retina-release-date-march-invite-how-to-watch-3593988/) suggests the staging of the new Macbook Air - a new 15-inch model to appear and the 11-inch one wiped out from its lineup. Yet more possibly we'll only be able to see it in WWDC in June.
