### What If VLC MOV Media Player not Working Happens?

Though VLC media player has most necessary codecs preinstalled including the MOV-relevant files, there are still various reasons causing VLC not playing MOV problem. The symptoms often occurring when VLC can't play MOV are image OK but no sound, VLC for Windows not playing MOV with Apple QuickTime codec, no suitable decoder module for MOV files, etc.

Among these issues, problems caused by damaged/corrupted MOV and encrypted MOV files are easy to solve. For a damaged MOV video, you can turn to some effective video repair tools for help or simply download the MOV file again if possible.

However, when VLC can't MOV videos because of video audio codec, the problem is not that easy to tackle.

A MOV file encoded with H.264/AAC is compatible with most of the [media players](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) including VLC media player in the market.
