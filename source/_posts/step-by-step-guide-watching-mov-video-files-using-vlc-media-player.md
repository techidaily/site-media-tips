### What If VLC MOV Media Player not Working Happens?

Though VLC media player has most necessary codecs preinstalled including the MOV-relevant files, there are still various reasons causing VLC not playing MOV problem.

Among these issues, problems caused by damaged/corrupted MOV and encrypted MOV files are easy to solve.

However, when VLC can't MOV videos because of video audio codec, the problem is not that easy to tackle.

A MOV file encoded with H.264/AAC is compatible with most of the [media players](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) including VLC media player in the market.
