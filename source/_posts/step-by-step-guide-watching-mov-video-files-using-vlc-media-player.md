### What If VLC MOV Media Player not Working Happens?

Though VLC media player has most necessary codecs preinstalled including the MOV-relevant files, there are still various reasons causing VLC not playing MOV problem. The symptoms often occurring when VLC can't play MOV are image OK but no sound, VLC for Windows not playing MOV with Apple QuickTime codec, no suitable decoder module for MOV files, etc.

Among these issues, problems caused by damaged/corrupted MOV and encrypted MOV files are easy to solve. For a damaged MOV video, you can turn to some effective video repair tools for help or simply download the MOV file again if possible. As for encrypted MOV files that VLC won't open, you can use DRM removal software to remove the protection for VLC to play. However, when VLC can't MOV videos because of video audio codec, the problem is not that easy to tackle.

**Codec issue causes VLC not playing MOV?**

Just like MP4 format, MOV is also a container format that uses a handful of video and audio codecs. A MOV file encoded with H.264/AAC is compatible with most of the [media players](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) including VLC media player in the market. However, when MOV is encoded with other video audio codec, there is no luck for you to play MOV on VLC. For instance, MOV file with Apple's QuickTime codec included cannot be played by VLC media player on Windows system.

**MOV can contain what codecs:** MOV is a MPEG-4 video container file similar to MP4, MKV and WMV, so it is really hard to list all the possible video audio that MOV may contain.
