With a huge collection of videos and music in your laptop, it will surely be pleasant to watch movies while chatting with friends on it. But compared to a HD and showy TV screen only yards away, this 15-inch screen seems kind of feeble. **[5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/)** here helps you **wirelessly connect laptop to TV** to stream movies, either through AirPlay or DLNA streaming and you can enjoy the video collection on a bigger screen without either cables or any latency.

### Most Stable Connection: Run a cable

Cable connection is old and wired, but compared to trendy connection from laptop to TV wireless, certainly it is the best choice for stability and speed, as well as solving the problems of [AirPlay delay](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/). An inexpensive and direct cable can ensure almost zero delay, but the problem is that you have to be physically tethered to the TV by the length of cable.

**\[Tips and Notes \]**  
 Make sure your laptop have an output port or DVI, and get yourself the right cable. For most wired adapters on sale, audio streaming is separated from video connection, and you'll need another audio patch for sound.

### The Progressive: Cast Computer to TV with Wireless HDMI

Although streaming PC to TV with cable is the most stable way, a more convenient, faster, and space-saving wireless connection is always the better. You can find many different types of wireless HDMI devices from Amazon, eBay, Wish, AIIiExpress and other shopping platforms. With the help of wireless HDMI kit, you can easily turn any computer a streaming server and any smart TV a streaming receiver. 

**\[Tips and Notes \]**  
If you want to connect laptop to TV with wireless HDMI, be a wise consumers, comparing the features and device costs before you purchase it. I don't think any of us are willing to waste even a penny. Also, check the ports of your PC and TV, and get yourself the right wireless HDMI equipment.

### 5KPlayer: Wirelessly Connect Laptop to TV with AirPlay DLNA

The technology behind the wireless connection from laptop to TV through 5KPlayer is the streaming skill called [AirPlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/). AirPlay was first proposed by Apple devices only but is now made possible to work on Windows PC with 5KPlayer. It is the service with which you can share video and music across devices without storing a copy at each. 5KPlayer solidly rooted in Apple base, now now makes AirPlay free and open to Mac users, in addition to this, users who need to wirelessly connect their laptop to the TV can easily enable DLNA/Miracast Windows 10 PC. However, just like the drawbacks of any other wireless connection, AirPlay delay/latency from laptop to TV is inevitable.

**\[Tips and Notes \]**  
 5KPlayer not only creates the connection, it also troubleshoots the connection by built-in function to solve AirPlay delay. And as most users find it feeble if a wireless port stops working, 5KPlayer provides the fool-proof solution in case the laptop to TV [wireless connection doesn't work](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/).

### Most Convenient Wireless Connection: WiDi

WiDi (Wireless Display Technology) is the option better appealing to the demand for wireless streaming from laptop to TV. This option at around $50 enables audio and video streaming at the same time.

**\[Tips and Notes \]**  
Take care that not every laptop has a WiDi built-in, and that small latency is inevitable for wireless streaming.  
**\[Free Alternative \]**  
 There's one free-of-charge alternative that covers WiDi advantages. Please turn to 5KPlayer:
