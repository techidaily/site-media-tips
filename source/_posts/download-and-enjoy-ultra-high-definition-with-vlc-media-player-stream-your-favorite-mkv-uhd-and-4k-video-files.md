## How to Play MKV 4K HEVC H.264 HD 1080p Videos via MKV Player VLC?

 _Written by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21)_ | Last updated: April 30, 2020 

The official site acclaims that VLC media player does play MKV files, so we can call it **MKV player VLC**. However, we are only told that the player supports MKV briefly but without telling which types of MKV video files that VLC can open. Despite the VLC MKV player has a strong fan base and is widely-recommended by editors, its performance of MKV HD H.264 HEVC 4K videos playback is to be studied. So, in this article we have chosen kinds of SD HD and 4K UHD MKV videos to throw at it to prove whether VLC media player plays MKV files or not.

**Contents:**  
[MKV Video Samples to Test MKV Player VLC >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/)

[Solutions to VLC not Playing MKV >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/)

Before see how VLC media player MKV performs when playing different kinds of MKV videos, I have upgraded my MKV player VLC to the newest version 3.0.4 on Windows. My computer's configuration is:  
**Processor:** AMD Athlon (tm) II X4 635 Processor 2.90 GHz  
**RAM:** 4.00GB  
**System:** 64 bit Windows 7

And the MKV video samples are downloaded from: http://jell.yfish.us/.

### MKV Video Samples to Test VLC MKV Video Player

**Sample 1\. 110Mbps HD H.264 1920x1080p Video in MKV Format**

**Video link:** http://jell.yfish.us/media/jellyfish-110-mbps-hd-h264.mkv  
**File size:** 394MB  
**CPU occupancy:** about 50%  
**Performance:** When playing this HD MKV video with [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html), it displays very smoothly with no quality loss. This is the highest bitrate of H.264 1920x1080 MKV video I have tested on this site, and it turns out to be very successful. Thus, it also indicates that MKV player VLC plays lower bitrate MKV videos of this type without any trouble.

**Sample 2\. 250Mbps 4K UHD H.264 3840x2160 MKV Video**

**Video link:** http://jell.yfish.us/media/jellyfish-250-mbps-4k-uhd-h264.mkv  
**File size:** 897MB  
**CPU occupancy:** about 75%  
**Performance:** When playing this kind of video, VLC MKV video player is not so competent. The sick performances are reflected by video choppy and choke performances, skipping frames and sometimes mosaics. Though I have turn on the [hardware acceleration](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) mode, it doesn't seem to work. Even worse, it reduces the fluency of my computer when trying to do other tasks. Since it doesn't act as good as I imagine, so I test some other lower bitrate 4K UHD H.264 3840x2160 videos from 120Mbps to 200Mbps, but only find that the MKV player VLC even can't handle the lowest bitrate 120Mbps 4K MKV video on this site.

![VLC Media Player MKV](https://www.5kplayer.com/vlc/img/4k-h264-250mbps-mkv.jpg) 

**Sample 3\. 110Mbps HD HEVC 1920x1080 MKV Video**

**Video link:** http://jell.yfish.us/media/jellyfish-110-mbps-hd-hevc.mkv  
**File size:** 401MB  
**CPU occupancy:** about 85%  
**Performance:** Actually, I had known [VLC HEVC 4K error](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) happens often, but I didn't prepare to reckon with VLC not playing HD HEVC problem. However, the truth is that when playing HD HEVC 1920x1080p MKV videos via VLC MKV media player, choppy performances, mosaics or skipping frames occurs in most cases. Sometimes, the playback window turns grey completely and the computer also gets very slow. Also, after testing other MKV HEVC videos from this site, it shows unpleasing results.  
 100Mbps/90Mbps/60Mbps/40Mbps 1920x10180 HEVC 10bit video: VLC is choppy.  
 100Mbps/90Mbps/80Mbps/70Mbps/60Mbps/50Mbps/40Mbps 1920x10180 HEVC video: VLC is choppy.

I've also test other MKV 4K HEVC videos from other sites, like http://4ksamples.com/elysium-2013-2160p-1-minute-sample-footage/, the image in VLC MKV media player just stays in one place. And when playing the other sample http://4ksamples.com/ses-astra-uhd-test-2-2160p-uhdtv/, MKV player VLC just shows a grey playback window with some mosaics.

**Conclusions:**  
After testing all of the MKV videos, it is not hard to know that MKV player VLC totally can't play high-res 4K HEVC videos or can play some high-res H.264 4K videos but with choppy performances. Good news is that the low bitrate videos are lucky to be opened by MKV VLC media player.   
Now that VLC media player MKV is not that competent to digest all types of MKV video files, what can you do when [VLC can't play MKV](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) problem happens.
