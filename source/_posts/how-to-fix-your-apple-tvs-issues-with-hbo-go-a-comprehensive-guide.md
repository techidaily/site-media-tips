**Note:**  
In May 2020, some old models of Apple TV are no longer support HBO GO, such as 2nd and 3rd gen Apple TV. Check if you have the newer Apple TV models that support HBO GO, otherwise you should get the alternative product to watch HBO TV series.

**1\. HBO GO AT&T Plan on Apple TV Problem:**  
_"I changed my AT&T plan to AT&T Unlimited Elite(SM) which comes with HBO GO however I cannot sign into the HBO Go app on the my Apple TV."_

**Fix:**  
Reinstall HBO GO App > select "Sign In" > Choose "Don’t Allow" the app to use TV providers subscription > get a given codec > go to the computer enter on the hbogo.com/activate site > go to use the activation code.

In April 2017, AT&T had HBO included as part of the AT&T Unlimited Plus wireless plan, and made it clear in that "If you currently subscribe to HBO through an AT&T video service – DIRECTV, DIRECTV NOW or U-verse TV – HBO will now be included for no additional charge". But, there are still similar problems, and the effective solution is very similar to the activation process of using HBO GO on Apple TV for the first time. You can follow the solution to try to solve the problem.

**2\. HBO GO on Apple TV with Bad Video Quality Problem:**  
_"I have been using HBOGo with Xbox 360 and today I just tried it on Apple TV. The quality is noticeable worse to me and my wife. The Xbox version just looks so much better. Has anyone else noticed this?"_

**Fix:**  
Restart the network and disconnected other devices with the same Wi-Fi to try get greater bandwidth. If it still does not work, try to change it to wired connection.

However, it is said that the majority of streaming services in Apple TV provide worse quality than other TV brands. And this technical problem is not related to the network connection, even the resolution of TVs, so there is no effective solution now.

**3\. HBO GO on Apple TV Cannot Stay Active Problem:**  
_"HBO go does not stay paired and active on my Apple TV. How do I prevent having to re-activate it each time?"_

**Fix:**  
Follow the tutorial above to activate HBO GO on Apple TV, then keep it start until goes to sleep mode, then there is an option to restart the Apple TV. After restarted, sign in and re-activate HBO GO App if it asked. 

It's another frequent problem that after connecting HBO GO App to Apple TV, you have to activate the TV periodically to keep it from shutting down. It is said that is caused by the device limit with HBO or Apple TV system settings, but if none of others Apps on the Apple TV has the same problem, it could be a problem with HBO GO server. 

**4\. HBO GO on Apple TV Autoplay Problem:**  
_"How can I stop Autoplay on HBO GO? It's so annoying that if I fall asleep to a show it just keeps playing and then I can't find where I left off."_

**Fix:**  
The [official HBO help site](https://help.hbonow.com/Answer/Detail/263) has proved that autoplay can't be turned off, and if you want to fix this problem, the alternative method is to pause or stop the video playback before the next episode begins.

But this intelligence also brings the inconvenience that if you forget to turn off while sleeping and just miss some hit-point of the video. Remember, once you turn on autoplay, you cannot turn it off again.

**5\. Error Message:**
