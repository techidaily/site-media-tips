### Disadvantages of Windows 10 Video Codec Pack

These codec packs indeed help beef up your Windows Media Player to play multimedia files without troubles, but they are actually not that satisfying. 

Firstly, codec pack from unauthorized sites may contain **virus**, **adware** or **spyware** that will corrupt the operating system of your computer or leave some other potential risks to your PC. Secondly, the newly downloaded Windows 10 codec pack may **conflict with the existed codecs** on your PC. Thirdly, the third-party codec packs **doesn't update frequently**, so they may not be compatible with your Windows 10 media player.
