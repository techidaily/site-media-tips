### VLC 4.0 Download: What's New?

The upcoming VLC 4.0 will have a brand-new look and a bunch of new features and enhancements. Here, we'd like to list all of the important details to help you make the decision to download VLC media player 4.0.

**1\. More Modern Design:** Many people think that the user interface of VLC media player is old-fashioned and even ugly, though VLC is much more popular than other [media players](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) out the market. Therefore, VLC 4.0 will try to be beautiful and modern by adding the ever-trending dark mode and some transparency elements, and redesigning the performance of icons and buttons.

**2\. New User Interface:** When opening up the developer version of VLC 4.0, you will see a "media browser" but not a "file opener", with thumbnails of all videos showing in the user's Videos folder. You can also see Music, Browse and Discover sections. BTW, VLC 4.0 instead spawns a new player window, separate from the browsing/control window from which the video was selected.
