TikTok is actually a mobile-based video creating and sharing app for iOS and Android. It is not that enjoyable when using it on computer through the browser, as you can only watch the videos but not create your own videos. So, if you are thinking of creating TikTok videos and watching TikTok videos on computer, especially when you want to demonstrate the process to others, you can try to stream TikTok from iPhone to computer with bigger screen.

5KPlayer is the very key that can unlock the door between your iPhone and computer wirelessly. Its inbuilt AirPlay technology can turn your Mac or PC into an [AirPlay receiver](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) to receive what’s screen mirrored from an iOS device, including TikTok videos, movies, music, apps, games, and so on. Swipe up the TikTok videos on your iPhone and 5KPlayer shows them accurately on computer. _[How to steps >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/)_

### TikTok Ban – Not Opening Problem

In July 2020, problems and outages for TikTok happened for 13 days, though it is not sure if it is because of Trump’s planning to shut down TikTok app in the United States.

However, after TikTok app had been banned in India, President Donald Trump on August 6 issued executive orders that would ban TikTok app in the US after September 15 if it is not sold by its Chinese-owned parent company to a US buyer. Obviously, TikTok is on the verge of being banned in America. Microsoft and Oracle are in talks to acquire TikTok app but the consequence is to be determined as of now. The ban decision may also happens in the UK and Australia.

So you’d better download your own TikTok videos and other favorites as soon as possible, for TikTok ban issue is a time bomb especially in the United States.
