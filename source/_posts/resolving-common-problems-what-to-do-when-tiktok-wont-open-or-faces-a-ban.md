#### **![](https://www.5kplayer.com/airplay/../seoimg/1.png) TikTok not Working on iPhone/Android? \[Solved\]**

**1\. Close and reopen TikTok app:** This often fixes a minor software crash problem.  
 • On an iPhone 8 or earlier, double-press the Home button to open the app switcher. On an iPhone X or newer, double-press the Home button or swipe up from the very bottom of the display to the center of the display. Once the app switcher is opened, swipe the TikTok app up and off the top of the screen to close it.  
 • On Android phones, you simply tap the back arrow to close TikTok app.

**2\. Check the network:** A strong and stable network can help get rid of TikTok video loading issues.  
 • **On iPhone:** Go to Settings > Tap on WLAN to make sure it is connected. Or Tap on Cellular to make sure the Cellular Data is turned on. If it’s already on, just turn it off and on again. If the network is still weak, it is better to contact your network server to upgrade your plan as video playback often costs much data.  
 • **On Android:** Open the Settings app > "Wireless and Networks" or "Connections" > Mobile data or Cellular data, and then make sure it is well connected. For WiFi Settings, just tap Wi-Fi.

**3\. Refresh or update the TikTok app:**

 • **On Android:** Go to "Google Play Store" on your Android phone > Search for the TikTok app > You will see the Update option on your mobile screen, just tap on it to update the app.

**4\. Clear the cache data of the app:** This can help solve the TikTok hanging and crashing problem, and TikTok videos not playing after sharing.  
 • **On iPhone:** Go to Settings > General > iPhone Storage > Scroll down to find TikTok app > Choose Delete App to remove the related cache data. If you want to reinstall the app, go to the App Store and reinstall it. Don’t worry, your Uploaded videos, Likes, Follow, Followers and Friends are still there once you log in.  
 • **On Android:** Open the Settings > Tap the Storage > Tap the Other Apps to see a list of installed apps > Find TikTok application and tap it > Then, tap the Clear cache button to clear data.

**5\. Restart your mobile phone:**  
 • **On iPhone:** If you are using iPhone 8 or earlier, press and hold down on the power button > when "slide to power off" appears on the screen, swipe the power icon from left to right to shut down your iPhone > Then, press and hold the power button again to turn your iPhone back on. If you are using iPhone X or newer, press and hold either volume button and the side button > when the "slide to power off" appears, swipe the power icon from left to right to shut down your iPhone > Then, press and hold the side button to turn on your iPhone again.  
 • **On Android:** Press and hold down the power button along with the volume up button until the screen turns black. Then, press and power button for few seconds to turn your Android phone back on.

**6\. Uninstall and reinstall TikTok app**  
 • **On iPhone:** Lightly press and hold on the TikTok app until a small X appears. Then, tap the X and tap delete to uninstall the TikoTok app on your iPhone. To reinstall TikTok on your iPhone, go to App Store and search for TikTok to install.  
 • **On Android:** Open the Settings menu on your Android phone > open Apps or Application manager (depending on your device) > find TikTok app and select it > tap on the Uninstall button to uninstall TikTok on Android. Then, go to Google Play Store to search for TikTok for Android and reinstall.

TikTok is actually a mobile-based video creating and sharing app for iOS and Android. It is not that enjoyable when using it on computer through the browser, as you can only watch the videos but not create your own videos. So, if you are thinking of creating TikTok videos and watching TikTok videos on computer, especially when you want to demonstrate the process to others, you can try to stream TikTok from iPhone to computer with bigger screen.

5KPlayer is the very key that can unlock the door between your iPhone and computer wirelessly. Its inbuilt AirPlay technology can turn your Mac or PC into an [AirPlay receiver](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) to receive what’s screen mirrored from an iOS device, including TikTok videos, movies, music, apps, games, and so on. Swipe up the TikTok videos on your iPhone and 5KPlayer shows them accurately on computer. _[How to steps >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/)_

### TikTok Ban – Not Opening Problem

In July 2020, problems and outages for TikTok happened for 13 days, though it is not sure if it is because of Trump’s planning to shut down TikTok app in the United States.

However, after TikTok app had been banned in India, President Donald Trump on August 6 issued executive orders that would ban TikTok app in the US after September 15 if it is not sold by its Chinese-owned parent company to a US buyer. Obviously, TikTok is on the verge of being banned in America. Microsoft and Oracle are in talks to acquire TikTok app but the consequence is to be determined as of now. The ban decision may also happens in the UK and Australia.

So you’d better download your own TikTok videos and other favorites as soon as possible, for TikTok ban issue is a time bomb especially in the United States.

## Step-by-step to Stream TikTok Videos from iPhone to Computer

**Step 1.** Free download AirPlay-enabled software 5KPlayer on your Mac or PC, install and launch it. Then, click on the "DLNA AirPlay" on the main UI of 5KPlayer to access 5KPlayer AirPlay Setting window, and turn on the AirPlay option.
