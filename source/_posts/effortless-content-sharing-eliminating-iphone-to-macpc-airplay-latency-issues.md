## AirPlay Lag \[Solved\] Hands-on Guide

 _Written by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21)_ | Last update: May 22, 2020

AirPlay delay or lag could be disappointing in the process of video AirPlay from iPhone iPad to Mac Windows 10\. In 4K streaming, AirPlay lag is even more frequent and serious, due to the highly-intensive H.265 streaming codec and large video file size, thus leading to audio and video out of sync in AirPlay. Now an intelligent tool can tackle AirPlay lag or delay resulting from poor network quality, AirPlay iPhone to Mac/Windows stability, and the video codec.

#### **The Causes of Video Lag and the Solutions**

1\. Unsupported AirPlay video formats

AirPlay now only supports video audio in MP4, MOV, M4V, MP3, and AAC. When starting AirPlay, the sender has to decode the video, prepare it for your display (real or virtual) and then re-encode it and send it to the receiver. If either sender or receiver cannot support the video format, AirPlay lags or even fails. To solve the problem, convert the video to the supported video format is necessary.

2\. Streaming videos in large file size

As mentioned above, processing large video files like high-resolution 4K video can be a huge challenge especially for some older devices. To solve 4K video streaming lag, reduce the desktop resolution to match smart TV size (effectively 1920x1080 or 1280x720 depending on your TVâ€™s resolution).

3\. AirPlay lags because of slow network bandwidth

We all know that AirPlay connects devices and sends content over Wi-Fi or Ethernet. Directly connecting devices with an Ethernet will cause less problems, while for convenience concern, Wi-Fi is always the priority choice. AirPlay testing videos in different formats and file sizes, if some videos do not stutter, consider whether Wi-Fi bandwidth is a problem. Is there too many devices take too much bandwidth and you can hope for a faster real-time transmission to solve this problem.
