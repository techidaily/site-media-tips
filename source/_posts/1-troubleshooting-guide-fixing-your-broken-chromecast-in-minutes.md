### Two Major Operations You Should Know:

[How to Reboot Chromecast?](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/)  
**Reboot Chromecast app** on Apple device > tap on Devices > tap the Cog Wheel > tap on the three stacked dots in the top right corner > tap Reboot Chromecast  
**Reboot Chromecast app** on Android device > open Chromecast app > tap on Devices > tap on the three stacked dots in the top right corner > tap Device Settings > tap on the three stacked dots in the top right corner > tap Reboot Chromecast  
**Reboot Chromecast device**: Unplug the power cord from the Chromecast device > Leave it unplugged for \~1 minute > Plug the power cord back in.  
Note: Unplugging the Chromecast from the TV's HDMI port does not reboot the device. It must be disconnected from the power source in order to reboot.

[How to Reset Chromecast? (factory data reset)](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/)  
**Reset Chromecast 1st Gen**:  
While the Chromecast is plugged into the TV, hold down the button on the Chromecast for at least 25 seconds or until the solid LED light begins flashing on the Chromecast device and the TV goes blank and begins the reboot sequence.  
**Reset Chromecast or Chromecast Ultra**:  
While the Chromecast is plugged into the TV, hold down the button on the side of the Chromecast. The LED will begin blinking orange. When the LED light turns white, release the button and the Chromecast will begin the reboot sequence.   
Note that the Chromecast wasn't powered 24/7 when USBed into my TV. That port would power the Chromecast, only when the TV was on. So make sure that you power your Chromecast with the provided power supply not other unqualified USB chargers.
