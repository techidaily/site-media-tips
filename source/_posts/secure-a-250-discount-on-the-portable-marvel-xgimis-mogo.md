## Secure a $250 Discount on the Portable Marvel: XGIMI's MoGo

Bring the home theater experience to any room with XGIMI's discounted [MoGo 2 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-MoGo-Pro-Projector-Bluetooth/dp/B0BWQB77LX?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002198&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fxgimi-mogo-2-pro-ultra-portable-projector-deal-march-2024%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). The projector, which previously scored [an 8/10 in our review](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/simplifying-streaming-key-tactics-for-youtube-and-twitch-via-obs-for-2024/), is currently at an all-time low price of just $350.

 The MoGo 2 Pro measures 6.3 inches tall and weighs just 2.4 pounds. It's an ultra-portable unit, yet it produces a stunning image with 90% DCI-P3 color coverage, and its integrated speakers (which double as Bluetooth speakers) will fill a room with sound.

 XGIMI's auto-keystone and autofocus technologies allow you to set up the MoGo 2 Pro in a matter of minutes, even when moving from room to room. Plus, the projector has Android 11 preinstalled, so you're free to use its HDMI port for a game console, computer, or some other video source.

The XGMI MoGo 2 Pro delivers stunning visuals for its size. Pre-loaded with Android TV 11, it's an excellent portable projector.

[$450 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-MoGo-Pro-Projector-Bluetooth/dp/B0BWQB77LX?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002198&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fxgimi-mogo-2-pro-ultra-portable-projector-deal-march-2024%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) [See at XGIMI](https://us.xgimi.com/products/mogo-2-pro?gclid=Cj0KCQjw4NujBhC5ARIsAF4Iv6dVyscBOJTaLmlsLJ6a3mZMnufPOsFsqtKG83q4mnWDH5lSNOe7uIUaAovAEALw%5FwcB) 

 As for basic usability, the XGIMI MoGo 2 Pro 2 offers 400 ISO lumens of brightness and is best used in dark environments. It doesn't have an internal battery and simply plugs into the wall, though it can run off a portable USB-C power bank. For the latter option, I suggest a [100-watt power bank](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-5-tracking-apps-to-track-vivo-x90s-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), as the projector must be used in Eco mode when paired with a slower external battery. (In any case, the power bank must be [65 watts](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Charger-PowerCore-Microsoft/dp/B0B9XHR6BG/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002198&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fxgimi-mogo-2-pro-ultra-portable-projector-deal-march-2024%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) or greater.)

 If you want a dedicated projector for your living room, a portable device like the MoGo 2 Pro may not be your best option. But this device is perfect for anyone who wants to host an occasional movie night while camping or hosting family. I should also note that this projector has an eye-protection featureâ€”the image will automatically dim if a child decides to stand in front of the projector.

 You can purchase the [XGIMI MoGo 2 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-MoGo-Pro-Projector-Bluetooth/dp/B0BWQB77LX?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002198&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fxgimi-mogo-2-pro-ultra-portable-projector-deal-march-2024%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) for $350 at Amazon or the [XGIMI website](https://us.xgimi.com/products/mogo-2-pro). The projector has an MSRP of $600 and rarely falls below $480\. According to [CamelCamelCamel's](https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0BWQB77LX) price tracker, this is the best deal on the MoGo 2 Pro to date.
