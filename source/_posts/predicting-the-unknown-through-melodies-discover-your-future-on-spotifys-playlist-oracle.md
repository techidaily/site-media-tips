## Predicting the Unknown Through Melodies: Discover Your Future on Spotify's Playlist Oracle

Another day, another weird feature from Spotify. The streaming app can now predict your future with [Song Psychic](https://songpsychic.byspotify.com/en/). Ask the psychic a question, and it will take you on a journey through the astral plane for a musical answer.

 To use Song Psychic, simply visit the [spotify.com/songpsychic](https://spotify.com/songpsychic) website in your phone's browser. Or, open the website on your computer and scan the QR code with your phone. The feature doesn't require a Spotify Premium account, though you need to be logged into the Spotify mobile app to access the psychic's knowledge.

 You cannot write personalized questions from Song Psychic. Instead, you must choose from a long list of pre-made questions. These questions are divided into nine categories—style, career, love, and lunch, to name a few. There's also an "Ask For Me" option that selects a random question.

 After asking a question, Song Psychic takes a few seconds to generate its answer. It eventually shows you the title of a song, plus the accompanying album art. Spotify says that the song title is the answer to your question—I suggest listening to the song, as it may provide more information about your future. Of course, the future hasn't been written yet, so you're free to press the reset button and generate new results if needed.

 The standout part of Song Psychic, at least for me, is the graphic design. Run your finger across the screen while Song Psychic is open to see a fantastic ripple effect. This effect is also present on the [Song Psychic desktop page](http://spotify.com/songpsychic).

 Spotify's music discovery features are usually playlist-oriented. But Song Psychic is far more simple than Spotify's [Pet Playlists](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-streaming-made-easier-learning-to-use-netflixs-dual-screen-feature/) or [AI DJ](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-amplify-your-videos-reach-perfect-title-description-and-tags-for-2024/). It's just a fun game with gorgeous graphics. If I had to guess, Spotify hopes that Song Psychic will go viral, as it's the kind of thing that's easy to screenshot and share.

 To reiterate, Song Psychic only works on mobile devices. Open [spotify.com/songpsychic](https://spotify.com/songpsychic) in your phone's browser, or open the website on your computer to scan a QR code from your phone. The feature is available in several languages, not just English.
