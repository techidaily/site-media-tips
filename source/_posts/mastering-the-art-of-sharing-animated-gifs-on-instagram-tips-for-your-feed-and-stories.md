## Part 2\. How to Save GIFs from Twitter on iPhone and Android Phone

Both the App Store and Google Play Store provide a variety of related apps specifically designed to[download GIFs](https://tools.techidaily.com/) from Twitter. You should check their features, reviews, ratings, and other information to select a reputable one.
