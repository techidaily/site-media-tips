If you have a kid under 9 at home, you'd find the Kids Lock feature of this video player tablet rather considerate. For this keeps the tablet running MX Player only (while playing a video for the kids while stepping away) unless you unlock it, hence no mistake phone calls.

For Android users, MX video player for Android tablet is also available in Google Play Store.

There are some quirks worth knowing before you decide to download Archos as the very tablet video player: Though it's gaining 1630+ 1/5 ratings from the users' side (which indeed proves its unstable performance) Archos video player for tablet is just as comprehensive as 5KPlayer in terms of subtitle downloading and torrent files playing on a tablet.
