If you have a kid under 9 at home, you'd find the Kids Lock feature of this video player tablet rather considerate. For this keeps the tablet running MX Player only (while playing a video for the kids while stepping away) unless you unlock it, hence no mistake phone calls.

For Android users, MX video player for Android tablet is also available in Google Play Store.

Download and install this video player for tablet, and Archos helps you access all the movies, videos in MP4 MKV MOV AVI in a way that outshines many. If you have ever tried 5KPlayer, you may find Archos video player operating likewire: It polishes each media file archived into your tablet with a creative poster art, thus making every pinch-and-opening of this video player for tablet an eye candy.

There are some quirks worth knowing before you decide to download Archos as the very tablet video player: Though it's gaining 1630+ 1/5 ratings from the users' side (which indeed proves its unstable performance) Archos video player for tablet is just as comprehensive as 5KPlayer in terms of subtitle downloading and torrent files playing on a tablet.

 TV connetion function is not very configurable, options like subtitle-adding is not straight-forward.
