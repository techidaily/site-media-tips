##  How to Enable the Crossfade Feature in Apple Music on Your iPhone or iPad

 To enable crossfade on an iPhone or iPad, go to Settings > Music > Crossfade. This feature was [introduced in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/assessing-data-protection-risks-in-using-chatgpt-technology/), and it blends tracks with a smooth fade transition. After enabling this feature, you'll see that as the current song nears its end, it slowly fades out while the next one gradually fades in, creating a perfectly continuous listening experience.

 To enable the crossfade feature in Apple Music on your iPhone or iPad, open the "Settings" app and tap "Music."
