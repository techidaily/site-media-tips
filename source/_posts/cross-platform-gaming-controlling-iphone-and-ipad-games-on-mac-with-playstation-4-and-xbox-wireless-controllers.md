#### **1\. Pair a PS4 DualShock 4 Controller with Your iOS 13 iPhone and iPadOS iPad**

If you're running iOS 13 or iPadOS 13, you can now use Sony PlayStation 4 DualShock 4 controller to play MFi controller-compatible games on your iPhone or iPad. All wireless DualShock 4 controllers work with Bluetooth, so everyone can be connected to iOS 13 or iPadOS device.
