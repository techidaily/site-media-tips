## New Era of Sports Viewing: ESPN, Fox, Warner Team Up to Launch Innovative Streaming Service

The experience of watching live sports through streaming services is a bit scattered right now. You like football? Go on Paramount+ or NFL+. More of a basketball person? NBA TV or Hulu might be for you. Do you like soccer better? For the MLS, you'll want to go on Apple TV+, and for European games, Hulu might be a good option. A sports-only streaming service might be the answer.

 ESPN, Fox, and Warner Bros Discovery are teaming up to create a new, [sports-focused streaming service](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/top-4-ways-to-trace-realme-note-50-location-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). This proposed streaming service, available through a new app, would be the closest thing to a one-stop-shop for everything sports, with a variety of sports to be streamed. You'll apparently have direct access to the top sports networks, including ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, ESPN+, SECN, ACCN, ESPNEWS, ABC, FOX, FS1, FS2, BTN, TNT, TBS, and truTV. From there, you can watch whatever you want. The sports leagues you'll be able to watch noted in the announcement post are the following:

* Football: NFL, UFL
* Basketball: NBA, WNBA
* Baseball: MLB
* Hockey: NHL
* Golf: PGA Tour, PGA Championship, The Masters, TGL
* Tennis: Wimbledon, US Open, Australian Open
* Soccer: FIFA World Cup, U.S. Soccer, NWSL, MLS, LaLiga, Bundesliga, UEFA Champions League, CONCACAF
* Fighting: UFC, Top Rank
* Racing: Formula 1, NASCAR, 24 Hours of Le Mans

 There are some notable omissions in this list. For one, the Premier League, England's top-flight soccer league (and widely considered Europe's most competitive) is not mentioned in the list. It could be a preliminary list, thoughâ€”all of those channels already show games that aren't mentioned here, so more might be added as streaming rights are updated and renewed as the three companies work on the service

 It's also worth noting that we don't know how much this streaming service will cost, or even how it will be called. We do know that the three companies are planning on launching this by the fall of 2024, so we'll likely see more info about this over the coming months. In the meantime, you'll still need to deal with one or multiple streaming services for your sports.
