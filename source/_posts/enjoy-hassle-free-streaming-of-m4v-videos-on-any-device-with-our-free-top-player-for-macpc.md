## Free M4V Player - Play M4V Video Files Directly on Mac/Windows

 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

None of your media players can play M4V files received from friends, recorded TV show/movies in .m4v format or some M4V videos downloaded online? Actually, it's not weird that M4V files cannot be played by iTunes, QuickTime Player and Windows Media Player. Well, what shall do next? Here, what we really suggest is that you download a **free M4V player** like 5KPlayer to play M4V files directly, rather than go through the hassle of format conversion or adding additional codec packs.

To play M4V files with a M4V player, we should puzzle out what is M4V first. M4V is a video container format containing H.264 video and AAC audio. It's a file format similar to MP4 format. And it is developed by Apple to encode TV episodes, movies, and music videos in the iTunes Store and natively supported by iTunes and QuickTime Player. But if you think you can open and play all M4V files with iTunes and QuickTime Player without any troubles, you are entirely mistaken. M4V videos from someone or somewhere instead of iTunes Store will not be played by iTunes. Only M4V files that meet the following specifications can be imported to iTunes: it must be encoded as 540 kbit/s (minimum) MPEG-4 video (H.264) with an approximately 128 kbit/s AAC audio track or encoded as 1.5 Mbit/s (minimum) MPEG-4 video (H.264) with a minimum 128 kbit/s AAC audio track. If you can't play M4V files with iTunes, QuickTime, VLC, Windows Media Player or others, converting M4V to compatible formats with [DVD Video Software for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) or [DVD video player for Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) is an option. But a dedicated free M4V player, namely 5KPlayer, is also a good alternative.

_Note: DRM protected M4V movies videos can only be recognized and played by Apple iTunes and QuickTime Player with authorization._
