### 3\. Stream Video from Android to TV Using HDMI Cable

It may sound cool to connect your phone to TV wirelessly. However, wireless streaming isn't always the best option, especially when your WIFI network doesn't offer a strong signal. Plus, there's the cost of buying a wireless receiver, such as the $35 Google Chromecast and the 69$-199$ Apple TV. And for older mobile devices, wireless streaming may not be an option at all. Given that, you'd better consider HDMI.

Unlike Android devices, iPhone was born with the wireless streaming service - Airplay. Therefore iPhone users can directly stream video from phone to Apple TV with no need of third-party apps. Besides, you can also [mirror iPhone screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) to TV for video playback via USB cable. Let's see how to do it.

### 2\. Play video from iPhone to TV with USB Cable

**Step 1.** Connect the Digital AV adapter to your iPhone.

**Step 2.** Connect the HDMI cable between your TV and Digital AV adapter.

#### **Consider This: Get a DLNA TV**

If you're considering a new TV, look for the DLNA-certified one that'll communicate with your phone or tablet easily, because a DLNA-certified phone such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 or HTC One M9 can connect to a DLNA TV, Xbox One, projector or set-top box, when you link them to your home Wi-Fi. And, best of all, there's nothing between your phone and TV for no wires needed and no streaming gadget required in order to play video from phone to TV. 

**Check if your device is DLNA complied:**
