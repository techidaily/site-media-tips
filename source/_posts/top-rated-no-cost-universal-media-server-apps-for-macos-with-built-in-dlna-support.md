 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

It seems to be a pipe-dream to stream Android to Mac and DLNA Mac to Android smart TV, as Apple Mac only allows media streams natively through Apple-certified protocol AirPlay. Though Apple products pride themselves on being safe due to the closed system, the restriction also offers much inconvenience indeed especially for sharing media streams with other systems like Windows and Android. So, **DLNA player Mac** is the key to open the door to let Mac interoperate with other non-AirPlay but DLNA-capable devices and allow you to send or receive media files wirelessly and freely.

The first reason to choose a DLNA/UPnP player Mac for [DLNA streaming](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/dlna/) is because Apple AirPlay protocol is limited in supported media formats, which will avoid you of streaming various sources from or to Mac. More specifically, Apple AirPlay only support MP4, MOV, M4V, MP3 and AAC streams, while DLNA player Mac allows you to both stream Android MKV AVC Webm 3GP VP8/VP9 AAC etc to Mac, and beam H.264/MP4 MP3 AAC from Mac to DLNA-compliant devices. The second reason to choose a DLNA media player Mac is that AirPlay is only useful among Apple-proved products, while DLNA enables the interactivity among billions of DLNA devices including Android phones, smart TV, PlayStation 3/4, Xbox One/360, DLNA-enabled speakers, to just name of few.

Therefore, in version 5.0.0, 5KPlayer adds the DLNA function to Mac to redefine itself as the [best DLNA complaint player for Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/dlna/) and Mac, thus allowing for all-round DLNA streaming service among numerous platforms. DLNA player Mac is the key to open the door and make communication between Mac and Android devices available to go.

First praised as a DLNA player or renderer, 5KPlayer Mac receives what you send from Android or other [DLNA servers](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/dlna/) instantly and display as perfect as the original. If you want to stream video music from Mac to Samsung/LG/Sony smart TV, PS4, Xbox, etc, UPnP player Mac 5KPlayer can change itself into a DLNA controller to help realize that.
