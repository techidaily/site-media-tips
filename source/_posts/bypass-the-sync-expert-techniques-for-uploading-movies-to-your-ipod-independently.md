## Can Xbox One Play DVDs? Here's the Answer

 As the successor to Xbox 360, Xbox One is a home video game console. Can Xbox One play DVD? The answer is "Yes". Xbox One falls into two categories: The hard drive version as well as optical device version. Xbox Store has a "Blu-ray Player" app, which is able to let you play videos not only from Blu-ray disc, but also DVD in the DVD-ROM version. But the hard drive version of Xbox does not allow you to play DVDs. Maybe that is thereason why many people say about "Xbox One cannot play DVDs". But you should pay attention, when you are going to play DVD movies on Xbox One DVD-ROM version, you should know that the optical drive may be likely broken. If you don't want to do this, you can optionally choose another solution, rip DVD movies to the video format that Xbox One supports instead of directly inputting the DVD disc into it. This article is prepared to show you that.
