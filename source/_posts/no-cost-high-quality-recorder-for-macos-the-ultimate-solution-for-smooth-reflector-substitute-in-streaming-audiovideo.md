## Why Do We Need Reflector Mac Alternative?

**1\. Reflector Mac Upgrade Fee**  
Though it officially sounds reasonable to pay for reflector Mac upgrade since they've put a lot of effort into this new version, however, being a regular, we can't stop asking why should we pay as the Reflector new users to get Reflector 2 upgrade? Why is the discount a time limit offer? And now Reflector 2 Mac upgrade discount is over, leaving the not upgraded users reluctant to march further. 

**2\. Reflector Mac Not Working Problems**  
Reflector Mac not working with iOS 13? Yes, exactly. Only Reflector 2 Mac/Windows includes support for iOS13 AirPlay mirroring and Reflector 1 Mac users shall upgrade to reflector 2 to obtain this new feature. Reflector Mac cracks oftentimes? Can't see your AirPlay icon? If these problems still are popping up frequently and not proper attended by reflector support team, you may want to try free Reflector Mac alternatives that are less troublesome.

**3\. Reflector Mac Not Supporting UHD 4K Streaming**  
1080P would be the maximum video quality that reflector can handle. >> Learn more about Reflector AirPlay to see its hurdles. However, our iPhone now can shoot videos in 4K, how to stream amd AirPlay those high-res videos with Reflector? That seems quite unnecessary to get a Reflector Mac for this.

**5\. Reflector Mac Promo Code Still Not Appealing**  
Similar to Airparrot promo codes, we can get discount for purchasing higher volume of Reflectors - say buying five computer license, we get $64.99; but we might not need that much and we still have to pay for the reflector Mac license key for each extra device. 

Don't be upset, becuase Reflector Mac might not be the ideal choice for AirPlay/Mirroring/recording. 

Here, we recommend you 5KPlayer, a piece of FREE multimedia software coming with built-in AirPlay support and includes iOS 13 support out of the box. It can wirelessly mirror and record screens and [receive streams up to 4K](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) from your iPhone/iPad (iOS 13 compatible).
