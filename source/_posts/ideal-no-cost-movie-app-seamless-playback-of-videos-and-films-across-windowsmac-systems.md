This thorny problem can be fixed with an all-in-one **free video player**, namely, [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/). It is widely accepted thanks to the capability of playing virtually all video files including MKV, HEVC (H.265), M2TS, MP4, AVI, MOV, FLV and so much more on Windows and Mac OS, Windows 10 and Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan included. Beyond that, it delivers high quality video audio effect and holds up less resources while playing 1080P HD, 4K, 5K and 8K ultra HD videos.

Cases like can't [play AVI](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) files on Mac, can't [play MOV](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) on Windows and the like happen frequently.

Moreover, you may have trouble [playing HD videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) like 1080P HD videos and 4K ultra HD sources.

5KPlayer is one of the [best free video players](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) compatible with Windows and Mac OS. It free plays almost all possible video file formats, like **MP4, MOV, AVI, WMV, MKV, HEVC, M2TS** and so much more. But some free video players just allow you to watch several files for free or cost nothing for very limited formats. If you need to watch MKV movies or something else, they will charge you for the service. But 5KPlayer is different. And most importantly, 5KPlayer is able to play **SD, 720P, 1080P, 4K, 5K UHD and 8K** videos without any glitches, like unexpected crashes, stutters, or video-audio sync issues.
