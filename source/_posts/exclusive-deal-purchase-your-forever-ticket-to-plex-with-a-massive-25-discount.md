## Exclusive Deal: Purchase Your Forever Ticket to Plex with a Massive 25% Discount!

It's hard to believe, but 2023 is already about to end. We're just a few days away from New Year's Day, and it seems like 2023 went by really, really fast. While Christmas may already be gone, we still have plenty of great deals that you can still check out, with more popping up every day. This time, Plex's lifetime Pass is discounted by 25% again, making it a fantastic purchase for anyone with their own media collection.

 The lifetime Plex Pass is now 25% off for the rest of the year, bringing the regular $119.99 price down to $89.99\. Plex is a tremendously useful resource for managing your personal media, and [Plex Pass](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-screensaviors-guide-global-and-regional-channels-led-by-you/) gives you access to a bunch of features that will make your experience even nicer, such as hardware-accelerated transcoding, downloads, skipping credits and intros for movies and shows, and early access to new features.

 While the monthly fee of $4.99 is not overly expensive, if you plan on using Plex for an extended period, it might be worth considering the lifetime subscription option. The regular lifetime subscription fee is $119.99, which is equivalent to the cost of a 24-month subscription. This new deal, however, reduces the price to, essentially, what you would pay for 18 months of service. Better yet, once you make the one-time payment for the lifetime subscription, you will not have to pay one extra dime to use the premium features of Plex ever again. This is the beauty of lifetime subscriptions. No recurring payments of any kind—just pay and forget.

 This is not the first time this deal has been available. Some of you might remember that Plex [ran an identical deal last month during Black Friday](https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-unlock-youtube-placement-secrets-what-matters-most/). You might not have hopped on it at the time, though—it was by far not the only sale during November, and you probably spent a lot of money on other stuff. While Plex seems to be running this pretty frequently, there's no telling when this deal will be popping up again.

 This deal is now live and will run through December 31st at 7:59 AM. You can [buy it from Plex's website](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001460/https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/purchase/?plan=lifetime&code=PEACEOUT23), using code **PEACEOUT23** at checkout if it's not applied automatically.
