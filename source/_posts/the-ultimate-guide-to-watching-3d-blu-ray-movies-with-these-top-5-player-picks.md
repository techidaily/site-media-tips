 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_ 

Stumbling upon a 3D Bluray movie recently, but your current video player just won't open it?   
 Probably you should switch to a **3D blu-ray player** for Windows 10 that is able to play the famous new titles like Doctor Strange, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, or the rest of high quality 3D bluray movies. End your search now with this review of top 5 3D Bluray players that are safe and reliable! 

**#2 Partial 3D Bluray Support - PotPlayer 3D Bluray**

**Price: Free**

![NO.2 PotPlayer - 3D Blu-ray Player](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/potplayer-4k.jpg) 

Ad-free and cost you no penny, the PotPlayer with partial 3D Blu-ray support may likely gear to those who want a clean hand.

PotPlayer goes smoothly not only with 3D Blu-ray movies, but also HD videos (H.264, H.265) as well as ripped videos. It attracts users very much by the function of accessing HD videos wrapped-up in ZIP or RAR files. 

As you may have noticed, some interaction features, such as BD-live is absent from PotPlayer, and that it won't download online videos like the free 5KPlayer, that's why we call it a "partial 3D Bluray player". Anyway, if you're interested in PotPlayer, the 3D Bluray feaures is not bad.

**#3 SNS Compatible 3D Bluray Player Software - Cyberlink PowerDVD**

**Price: $99.95**

![NO.2 PowerDVD - 3D Bluray player](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/../video-music-player-jp/img/powerdvd.jpg) 

Cyberlink PowerDVD is another much-favored 3D Blu-ray player software. All Blu-ray 3D movies, be it from online movie websites, or a licensed physical copy, can sit through PowerDVD without hiccups. Just like 5KPlayer, PowerDVD is a 3D Bluray player featuring extensive format support: for MP4, MKV, MOV and AVI, it is also able to go up to play 4K videos.  
 Here's one highlight about this player that may impress you: the 3D Blu-ray live support, which means you can real-time share what you're watching from PowerDVD's SNS plug-ins, and also take a fresh bite on some special features of Bluray 3D movies that are not presented on the optical discs.  
 If this 3D Bluray player is your cup of tea, check out the PowerDVD coupon code to see if you can get the latest discount.

**#4 Swift 3D Blu-ray Player Software - Leawo Blu-ray Player 1.3.0.45**

**Price: $59.95**

![NO.5 Leawo Bluray Player - 3D Blu-ray Player](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/../video-music-player-jp/img/leawo-bluray-player.png) 

By and large, Leawo Blu-ray Player 1.3.0.45 is the least CPU-demanding 3D Blu-ray player of all, perhaps only second to 5KPlayer. Considering the high frame rate of 3D movies and its up-to-Bluray standard - hopefully 2160p 4K, it's indeed quite important to reasonably allot the use of CPU to your 3D-Bluray player software, otherwise all the rest applications might just crash. Fortunately, Leawo Blu-ray Player is one such option: It takes an average 4% of CPU when properly running, a performance just as sleek as 5KPlayer.   
 Fitting support for DVD, 3D Blu-ray and 4K movies into a freeware, we find the seldom advertisement in Leawo 3D Blu-ray player quite acceptable. Though the ad-free 5KPlayer is indeed a rather pleasant option, if you're good to go with ads, this is a viable option.

**#5 3D Bluray Player - SlySoft AnyDVD HD**

**Price: $155 for Lifetime & $82 for A Year**

![NO.5 AnyDVD-3D Blu-ray Player](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/anydvd.jpg) 

The most pricy piece of 3D Bluray player in today's recommendation, and it's definitely not an irrational inflation - SlySoft AnyDVD is a piece of 3D Blu-ray DVD player that can overcome the biggest gap between a physical 3D Bluray player and a software application: The Blu-ray DVD encryption. (We've not yet tested that though).   
 Namely AnyDVD HD lets you play any disc irrespective of its region code and without an HDCP-compliant graphics card or display.  
 It's available as a free trial for 21 days, but after that you'll have shell out the money for a full version, and price ranges depending on the time you plan to go with this Blu-ray 3D player software.

**#1 Anticipated 3D Blu-ray Player Software for Windows 10 - 5KPlayer**
