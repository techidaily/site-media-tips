## AirPlay 2 Mirroring Not Working Troubleshoot

 _Written by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21)_ | Last update: April 28, 2020

Updated to iOS 11.4 yet only to find iOS 11 screen mirroring not working from iPhone to PC. The problem might possibly lie in the newly upgraded AirPlay 2.0\. Since the freshly baked AirPlay 2.0 with multi-room audio streaming feature can inevitably bring along some incompability troubles as well as streaming bugs and other complicated connection issues.

## AirPlay 2 vs AirPlay

Before jumping to solutions, we should first understand about [AirPlay 2 in comparison with AirPlay 1.0](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/)

AirPlay 2 is only elevated from AirPlay 1.0 from the below aspect - Multi-device multi-audio streaming simultaneously controlled from one center - your iOS device. This means that you can control the multi-audio streaming playbacks on several different speakers respectively from one end. This even includes Apple TV connected speakers which are not AirPlay compatible.

_Note that Apple TV when running tvOS 11.4 will be compatible with AirPlay 2 protocol. iPhone 5S, iPad Air, and iPad mini 2 that can update to iOS 11.4 are privileged to AirPlay 2.0\._ 

Sadly, Apple hasn't adopted a multi-screen mirroring feature for AirPlay 2 mirroring, or multi-video streaming feature in response to the multi-audio streaming utility. The actual AirPlay 2 mirroring is no different from the original AirPlay mirroring working mechanism. And as usual, we can only mirroring our screen in a one-on-one manner. The iOS screen mirroring function stays as it was without change in this 2.0 upgrade. 

Therefore, if your iPhone X is upgraded to iOS 11.4 with AirPlay 2 supported yet your Apple TV is the old 2nd gen without tvOS 11.4 update, AirPlay 2 is impossible to run. And your AirPlay connection will only fall back to the first gen AirPlay protocol for streaming and AirPlay mirroring.
