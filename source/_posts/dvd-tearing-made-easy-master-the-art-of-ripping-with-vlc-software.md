### How to Rip DVD If VLC Rip DVD Function Doesn't Work?

Actually, [VLC DVD player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) and DVD ripper performs slowly and won't always work when ripping DVD. VLC only rips DVD for you, but doesn't have as many controls for choosing exactly the right format. Thus, you may also need a [video converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) to convert the ripped DVD file to a proper size. Though VLC DVD ripper also offers the possibility for you to choose the specific track, title or chapter, you have to spend some time to figure out the right one.

However, [WinX DVD Ripper](https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/dvd-ripper-platinum/) would not give you such confusion.
