## Limited Offer: Stream Disney's Magic on Your TV for as Little as $1.99 per Month!

###  UPDATE: 2023/09/19 12:37 EST BY CORBIN DAVENPORT

**_Offer Will Expire Soon_** 

 The temporary discount on Disney+ subscriptions [will end](https://help.disneyplus.com/article/disneyplus-limited-time-offer?redirect=false) after September 20th, 2023, so this is your last chance to check it out.

 Many of the subscription services we've come to know and love over the years [have increased their prices](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-elite-road-warriors-game-list/), and while these are usually $1 and $2 increases, those extra few bucks can add up after multiple price hikes or paying for multiple services. Because of this, deals are more important than ever. Right now, you can snag an awesome deal on Disney+, as long as you're willing to cope with ads.

 Disney+ is currently running a deal that will get you three months of ad-supported Disney+ service for just $1.99 a month for three months â€” by the end of the three-month period, you'd have paid just $5.97\. After this period expires, the subscription will renew at the usual $7.99 a month price point. Think of this as a sort of paid trial. If you want to check out whether you'll like the service, you can commit to three months without having to pay full price for it. It's not quite a free trial, but $2 a month is fairly cheap, especially considering the full price is $8 a month. Basically, you're paying less than the regular monthly fee for three months of service.

 The ad-supported version of Disney+ [was introduced by the end of last year](https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-gimbal-insights-7-best-in-market-for-2024/), in an attempt to keep users as the company [increased the ad-free tier's price](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-unleashing-the-power-of-screen-capture-with-hp-notebooks/) from $7.99 to $10.99\. Now, as the company is headed towards [increasing the price](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-strategizing-your-approach-highlight-and-story-downloads/)_[again](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-strategizing-your-approach-highlight-and-story-downloads/)_ from $10.99 to $13.99 on October 12th, while it tries to kill password sharing _a la_ Netflix, it looks like this discount is Disney's way of saying "whoops, sorry, don't be mad at us." For what it's worth, the ad-free tier is currently $7.99 a month and is not getting a price increase, but given how things are going right now, we wouldn't be surprised if this happens sooner or later too.

 If you want to try out Disney+ and its vast array of content ([although it occasionally removes some content](https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-is-the-best-pokemon-for-pokemon-pvp-ranking-on-samsung-galaxy-a24-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/)), make sure to hop on this offer now. It's only available for "new and eligible returning subscribers," according to Amazon, so current customers can't take advantage of the offer.
