How to **AirPlay with Beamer**?

## How to Use Beamer to Airplay Videos from Mac to Apple TV?

With high playback quality in regard of image (full HD support) & sound (5.1 surround sound) and support for almost all common formats and codecs, Beamer is an easy and the quickest solution for you to AirPlay video from Mac to Apple TV, as it works just like a regular media player but the video plays on Apple-TV.

How to AirPlay with Beamer to stream videos from Mac to Apple TV? Forget all the limitations you know about AirPlay on the Mac! To realize **Beamer AirPlay video**, all you need to do is to download the Beamer and drag a video onto the interface for AirPlay. The Beamer will automatically detect the AirPlay receivers, and you can select the target receiver in the popup menu by clicking the AirPlay icon at the lower-right corner. The Beamer new 2.0 version also creates playlists to queue up a bunch of videos for watching in succession. Beamer also remembers what you have watched and at what point in the video you stopped watching.
