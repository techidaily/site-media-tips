Although, the war between Mac and Windows devotees has been raging for decades, the vast majority of computer users are still windows users and they have their good reasons(cheaper, more flexible, ideal for gamers, enterprises and heavy CPU/GPU tasks like CAD&3D rendering). But, in regard of brilliant features like AirPlay developed by Apple Company, no one on whichever platform can refuse! Therefore, to meet the needs of those windows users who want to AirPlay PC videos, [**5KPlayer**](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) is suggested here since it provides the easiest way.

## Where to Get AirPlay for Windows PC?

There are many approaches to get AirPlay for your Windows PC, for example:

**5KPlayer**  
 As 5KPlayer Windows version can turn PC into an AirPlay sender as well as a PC AirPlay receiver, we can resort to it to stream almost any videos and music from AirPlay-enabled devices to PC or AirPlay PC movies and music to Apple TV. 5KPlayer is a 4K video player that supports HD 1080p video quality and 7.1 surround sound which can ensure you fascinating visual and audio enjoyment. It also supports third-party Apps like Spotify and Pandora which allows you to listen to music wirelessly with better stereo system.

**AirPlay Alternative for Windows PC –WIDI:**   
 Intel wireless display is supported by many newer Intel-based PCs and Windows 8.1 OS. If you have Windows 8, you can upgrade to Windows 8.1 for free. This means that you can use WIDI technology as a substitute to AirPlay on your windows 8.1 PC to stream videos and music to TV. 

**Plex**  
The Plex program runs as a media server on Windows or Apple computers and streams to a wide array of devices that connect to your TV like an Apple TV. It streams video files (as well as music and photos) that reside on your computer to these devices, but it doesn't stream video you play in a Web browser, such as Netflix.

Amongst the listed above, 5KPlayer is your best and simplest choice, since WIDI requires you to check your computer configurations which may bring a lot of troubles, and Plex asks for creating a Plex account which may take you lots of time before AirPlay PC videos.
