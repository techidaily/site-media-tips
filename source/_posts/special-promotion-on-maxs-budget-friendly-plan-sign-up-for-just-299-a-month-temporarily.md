## Special Promotion on Max's Budget-Friendly Plan - Sign Up For Just $2.99 a Month (Temporarily)

Max is currently offering a 70% discount for six months on its ad-supported streaming plan. Now's the time to sign up and enjoy Max's collection of exclusive content, including "The Last of Us" and a smorgasbord of Christmas movies. This offer is available until Monday, November 27th.

 The "[Max with Ads](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.max.com%2F)" plan usually costs $9.99 a month. This 70% discount drags the price down to just $2.99, which adds up to $42 in savings after your six-month offer is complete. Unlike other ad-supported streaming plans, which tend to be very restrictive, "Max with Ads" allows you to stream the full Max catalog in 1080p. You can also stream to two devices concurrently, meaning that "Max with Ads" may be shared with a family member, friend, or roommate.

 Oddly enough, this streaming offer also comes with the [B/R Sports add-on](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.max.com%2Fsports). It's a $9.99 monthly value that allows you to stream 300 live games from the NBA, NHL, MLB, and U.S. Soccer leagues. Select games from the NCAA March Madness tournament are also included, though the B/R Sports add-on will cost money after February 29, 2024.

 The "Max with Ads" plan does not include access to offline downloads for movies and shows. And, of course, it forces you to watch occasional advertisements. If you want an ad-free plan with offline downloads, you have to sign up for "Max Ad Free," which costs $16 each month or $150 annually. A "Max Ultimate" subscription, which is $20 a month or $200 annually, is required for 4K streaming and Dolby Atmos audio. Unfortunately, neither of these ad-free plans are on sale.

 New and returning subscribers are for this offer. After paying just $2.99 for six months of "[Max with Ads](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.max.com%2F)," your subscription will automatically renew at the full price of $9.99\. Set yourself a reminder if you want to cancel (or upgrade to a fancy ad-free plan) after your six-month discount ends. Please note that this offer expires on Monday, November 27thâ€”if you want to save 70% on six months of "Max with Ads," you need to sign up this week.
