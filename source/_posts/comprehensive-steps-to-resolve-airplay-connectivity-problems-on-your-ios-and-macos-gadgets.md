If you are encountering cannot stream contents using AirPlay, or cannot screen mirroring iPhone, iPad or Mac to Apple TV, Apple Support has given some workarounds here: _https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204291_.

**Solution 1\. Make sure that your devices are turned on and nearby.**  
 • If the Apple TV is in Sleep mode and uses Ethernet, wake your Apple TV up with the remote so as to eliminate the “looking for Apple TV” message.  
 • Keep a close distance between your devices. If they still can’t get connection, try to move them closer.  
 • To stream audio to multiple speakers with AirPlay 2, make sure that your speakers are compatible with AirPlay 2.

**Solution 2\. Update your device to the latest OS.**  
 • **iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch:** Plug your device into power and connect to the Internet with WiFi > go to Settings > General > tap Software Update > tap Download and Install > tap Install > If asked, enter your passcode.  
 • **Apple TV:** Go to Settings > System > Software Updates and select Update Software > if there’s an update, select Download and Install > after the update downloads, your Apple TV will restart, prepare the update and then install the update.  
 • **HomePod:** On iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, open the Home app and tap Home in the upper-left corner > tap Software Update > if there is a new update, tap Install. On your Mac, open the Home app > in the menu bar, choose Edit > Edit Home > click Software Update > if there is a new update, click Install.  
 • **Mac:** On Mac with macOS Mojave or later, choose System Preferences from the Apple menu > click Software Update to check for updates > if there is an update, click on the Update Now button to install it. On Mac with earlier macOS, open the App Store app on your Mac > click Updates in the App Store toolbar > click the Update buttons to download and install any updates listed.  
 • **Smart TVs:** You are suggested to contact a third-party vendor or developer to get help with the product.

**Solution 3\. Connect your devices to the same WiFi-network**  
 • Worth mentioning, if you are trying to AirPlay to Apple TV, connect your Apple TV directly to your router with an Ethernet cable instead of using WiFi to make sure the network is always strong.

**Solution 4\. Check the AirPlay settings**  
 • On Apple TV, you might have restricted who can AirPlay.  
 • On HomePod, you might have restricted speaker access.  
 • For AirPlay 2, you might need to invite others to control your home so they can AirPlay to your devices.  
 • You can’t AirPlay to HomePod if you select Only People Sharing This Home. So, deselect it.
