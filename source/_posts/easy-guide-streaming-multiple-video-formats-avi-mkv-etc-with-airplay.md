## Part 1: Convert AVI/MKV/WMV/FLV/DivX to AirPlay Compatible Formats

Before you start to airplay videos, make sure your videos are AirPlay-compatible as AirPlay can only work with those files that can be added to iTunes including MP4, M4V, MOV, MP3, M4A and AAC. As for other formats like MKV, AVI, WMV, FLV, DivX, XviD, MPEG etc which are not supported by iTunes, AirPlay fails to handle either. To put it in another way, to successfully airplay AVI, MKV, WMV, FLV DivX files to Apple TV/Apple TV2/Apple TV3, you will need [a DVD video converter software for Mac OS](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) or [Windows PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/)to convert those videos to AirPlay supported formats.
