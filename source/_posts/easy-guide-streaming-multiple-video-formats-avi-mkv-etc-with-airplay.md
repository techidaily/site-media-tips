Before you start to airplay videos, make sure your videos are AirPlay-compatible as AirPlay can only work with those files that can be added to iTunes including MP4, M4V, MOV, MP3, M4A and AAC. As for other formats like MKV, AVI, WMV, FLV, DivX, XviD, MPEG etc which are not supported by iTunes, AirPlay fails to handle either.
