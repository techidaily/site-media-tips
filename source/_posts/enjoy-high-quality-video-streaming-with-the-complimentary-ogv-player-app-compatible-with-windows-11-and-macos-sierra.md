The below is some basic criteria you should considering for choosing your ideal powerful OGV player:  
 a. Sleek interface with quick response;  
 b. Complete set of splitters for demuxing files contained in OGV;  
c. Equipped with plenty of codecs and latest codecs like H.265 VP9 to decode almost all video codecs;  
d. Free download OGV files from online like Dailymotion and YouTube;  
e. Built-in OGV to MP4/OGV to AVI converter to convert OGV to other formats
