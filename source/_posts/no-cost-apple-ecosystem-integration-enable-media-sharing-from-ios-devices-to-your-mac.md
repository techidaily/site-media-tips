## Top AirPlay Receiver for Mac Cheaper & Better than Apple TV

 _Written by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21)_ | Last update: April 28, 2020

Speaking of AirPlay receiver, the first media streamer appears on your radar might be Apple TV. But now you will know another better AirPlay receiver-**5KPlayer**, which enables you to stream video (SD & HD) music (MP3, FLAC, AAC, AC3, WMA) from iPhone XS/XS Max/XR/X/8/7/SE/6/6 Plus; iPad Pro/mini 3/Air 2 to iMac/MacBook Air/Pro without any dent in your wallet. And moreover, this top-ranking AirPlay receiver acts as a reliable AirPlay sender to stream video audio from Mac (OS X/OS Sierra/ OS Mojave/OS Catalina) to Apple TV, as well. 

Apple TV replacement field has become a crowed one these days and several Apple TV alternatives appear to stimulate your interests, like Chromecast, Roku, Amazon Fire TV and Google Nexus Player, etc. All these four **media streamers** are not only the streaming boxes in the market, but they all have a high profile in the globe and for good reason- they are all priced under $100, marginally cheaper than Apple TV.

Beyond question, these four **media center software** beat the pants off Apple TV in price, but all of them are actually tweedledum and tweedledee in functionality, since they all have their respective pros and cons. See, Apple TV is an awesome iOS companion but with fewer apps and features than others; Chromecast has an edge in lower price, smaller size and simplicity, but becomes overshadowed with no true TV interface or remote. And Roku earns a wide wave of popularity due to more choice of devices and apps, yet imperfect because of weak mirroring and gaming. In such case, you might doubt whether there is one being cheaper and better than Apple TV?
