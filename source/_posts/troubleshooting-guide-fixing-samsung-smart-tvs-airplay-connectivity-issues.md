According to report, Samsung QLED TVs, 4K and 8K TVs, CES, CES2019, The Frame TV and Serif lifestyle TVs, as well as other Samsung UHD and HD models of 2019 lines will all add support for AirPlay 2.

If you are buying a new Samsung TV, ask the salesman to show that your purchased model has Apple AirPlay tech logo attached for sure.

Note that to use AirPlay 2 Samsung TV you will have to meet three requirements, i.e. **an iOS 11.4 and newer device** \+ **an AirPlay 2 compatible Samsung TV**  \+ **same WIFI connection**.
