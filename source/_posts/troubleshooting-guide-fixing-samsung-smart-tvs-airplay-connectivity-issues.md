![AirPlay 2 vs AirPlay vs DLNA](https://www.5kplayer.com/airplay/../dlna/img/pc-to-samsung-tv.png) 

It's obvious that if you are using a Samsung TV that does not support AirPlay 2, you AirPlay plan won't work out as expected. Then what are those Samsung smart TV models that supports Apple AirPlay 2?

According to report, Samsung QLED TVs, 4K and 8K TVs, CES, CES2019, The Frame TV and Serif lifestyle TVs, as well as other Samsung UHD and HD models of 2019 lines will all add support for AirPlay 2.

If you are buying a new Samsung TV, ask the salesman to show that your purchased model has Apple AirPlay tech logo attached for sure. 

### How to AirPlay Samsung TV from iPhone/iPad/iPod?

Note that to use AirPlay 2 Samsung TV you will have to meet three requirements, i.e. **an iOS 11.4 and newer device** \+ **an AirPlay 2 compatible Samsung TV**  \+ **same WIFI connection**. When the AirPlay 2 sender and receivers connected the same WIFI network, your device will auto-detect your AirPlay enabled Samsung TV.

**Step 1:** Turn on your Samsung TV;

**Step 2:** Connect iPhone/iPad and your Samsung TV to the same WIFI network;

**Step 3:** Go to iOS control center and tap **Screen Mirroring** \- your iOS device will be looking for Samsung TV automatically.

### AirPlay 2 Samsung TV Not Working Solutions

No matter it is a Samsung TV AirPlay 2 connections issue, audio issue, playlist issue, Samsung TV AirPlay 2 multi-room issue, or Samsung TV AirPlay 2 not working with third-party app issues, we have a simple general solution to save your asses. 

1\. Reboot and reconnect your Samsung TV and iPhone/iPad/computer to the same WIFI network (reboot your router/internet if necessary).
