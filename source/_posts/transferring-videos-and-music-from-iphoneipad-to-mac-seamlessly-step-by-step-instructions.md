 _Written by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21)_ | Last update: May 20, 2020

Wonder if you can stream video and audio from iPad, Phone (11/11 Pro/11 Pro Max and the earlier models) to Mac? Surely yes. The superb streaming player 5KPlayer can easily help you stream videos, movies, music from iPhone 11 and before, iPad and other iOS devices to Mac, with untouched video quality. Learn how to use 5KPlayer to stream your favorite videos and music from iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch to Mac wirelessly now! 

Smartphones and tablets today can delivery almost everything you can expect of a digital product, especially those fully-functional ones with stunning display and fine resolution like iPhone 11/11 Pro/11 Pro Max (and the earlier models), iPad Pro, Air, Mini and so on, but when it comes to video or audio, why just get stuck watching videos or enjoying music on a tiny screen? Surely a larger display and better speaker come with a more satisfying experience. Instead of copying the video and audio to Mac and occupy your computer's space, you are suggested to directly **stream video and audio from iPad, iPhone to Mac**.

## How to Stream Video Audio from iOS 13 to Mac with a Streaming Player

Speaking of streaming video software, Mac users are unfortunately facing with limited choices, as most of which are designed to stream Mac to iPhone, iPad etc, and when it comes to [stream from iOS to Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/), that number shrinks close to zero. Here is a well-known trick (not officially announced by Apple) that enforces streaming iOS devices to Mac by using QuickTime Player. But this trick does not always work and faces problems like:

1\. Streaming video and dropping frames  
2\. Steaming video but only audio works   
3\. Choosing the device to stream but it cannot be connected   
4\. Selecting the given option but it automatically reselects the built-in speakers  
5\. Other problems like streaming interrupt, choppy, black screen, etc. 

If you are looking for solutions to fix the problems above, you will soon find that there is little information that can provide solutions, and most of them do not work. Also, we do not want to ask you to direct connecting iPhone or iPad to Mac with a lightning cable although it provides the most stable and fastest content streaming experience. To stream video from iOS to Mac, the unparalleled streaming software for Mac 5KPlayer, which is able to stream iOS to Mac, comes to your help. This all-in-one streaming player, serves as an AirPlay receiver, can stream any videos, movies and music, like the hot movie _Parasite, HBO Westworld TV series, Disney Onward, Taylor Swift – The Man (music MV)_ and many more, from iPad iPhone to Mac based on Apple's wireless technology AirPlay, with no quality loss and no storage space needed.
