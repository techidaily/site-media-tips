Want to show the whole screen of our iPhone 11/XS Max/XS/XR etc. or iPad/iPad Pro on bigger screens or play certain audio files on a better or louder speaker for example, on Mac or PC? AirPlay is born to fix problems of this kind. It is a protocol to share files among certain Apple products. With AirPlay, the mirroring function can be easily achieved. A free AirPlay server to **mirror iPhone to Mac**/PC at one go is introduced thereby.

5KPlayer is the latest media player released by DearMob, Inc., which can run on Mac OS X, macOS High Sierra, macOS Mojave, macOS Catalina, macOS Big Sur and Windows PC. One of the highlights of this very software is that it [supports AirPlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/), which means 5KPlayer can turn Mac and Windows PC into an [AirPlay server](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) to mirror iPhone screen on Mac and Windows. Hence, users can enjoy the audio and video files of iPhone on the bigger screen of their Mac or Windows computers. This wireless files sharing is achieved by streaming the files to Mac/PC. 5KPlayer is compatible with a wide variety of AirPlay enabled third-party applications, so there's no complicated set up or need for adapters and wires. 5KPlayer can be set always on top to keep your device on top of all other apps for your convenience as well.

5KPlayer from DearMob can be simply launched with minimal configuration to ensure the best quality for your specific iOS devices (including iPhone 11/X/XS Max/XS/XR, iPad and iPad Pro), and you can then connect your iOS devices via AirPlay from the Control Center panel.

So the mirroring will not affect the performance of the streamed devices at all. There are no plugins and bundled software in 5KPlayer, and all the functions are realized solely by 5KPlayer, which keeps 5KPlayer a clean and green software to mirror iPhone to Mac and Windows PC.
