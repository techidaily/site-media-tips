 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

Now that the PS4 media player has made it possible for a **PS4 media server** to connect to the game console to play MKV AVI MP4 videos, MP3 AAC music, or even photos. You may need to turn computer into a PS4 media server Windows 10 to share everything in the computer library to the bigger screen, now check to find out.

## Requirements: PS4 Meida Player + PS 4 Media Server Windows 10/Mac

Whenever you need to stream computer to PS4, the PS4 media player needs to come into play: for classic PlayStation 4 models, the Media Player APP easily helps users stream whatever on a DLNA server to the target TV screen connected to the game console. While for PS4 Pro and PS4 VR models, the APP also receives videos, music & photos stored in a USB driver, on condition that the display supports up to 4K. 

Now that you've launched the PS4 Media Player, and the last step to successfully stream PC to PS4 is a reliable PS4 Media Server Windows 10 or Mac. You may start to set up computer or Mac into a [DLNA server Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/dlna/) using such software as Universal Media Server, or free 5KPlayer.

## Why We Choose 5KPlayer to Set Up Computer As PS4 Media Server?

To set up a PS4 media server Windows 10 or Mac, you'll need to turn the computer into a DLNA server recognizable for a PlayStation console. Back in time when there were only PS3 media server, Universal Media Server, and Plex media server, user-experience with multimedia collections on computer were carried out in a quite loose manner: Amongst the PlayStation media servers mentions just now, users get nothing more than bare-bone & still service as "servers", which means even the most multi-purpose Universal Media Server could do no more than H.264 transcoding or DVD support. 

5KPlayer is designated to combine a media server & one-stop media hub all-in-one: apart from turning computer into a PS4 media server, it's extremely helpful as a standalone media player for Windows 10 and Mac (DLNA utility for Mac coming soon) is capable of:

\* DLNA streaming video music from Android to PC, PC to TV & act as a PS4 media server.   
\* AirPlay mirror iPhone to Mac or Windows & record the mirroring images.

\* Play H.264, H.265 4K videos, Virtual Reality videos & DVD, VCD, CDs, now free download it below:
