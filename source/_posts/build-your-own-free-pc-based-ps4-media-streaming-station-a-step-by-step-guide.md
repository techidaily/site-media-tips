Now that the PS4 media player has made it possible for a **PS4 media server** to connect to the game console to play MKV AVI MP4 videos, MP3 AAC music, or even photos. You may need to turn computer into a PS4 media server Windows 10 to share everything in the computer library to the bigger screen, now check to find out.

## Requirements: PS4 Meida Player + PS 4 Media Server Windows 10/Mac

Whenever you need to stream computer to PS4, the PS4 media player needs to come into play: for classic PlayStation 4 models, the Media Player APP easily helps users stream whatever on a DLNA server to the target TV screen connected to the game console. While for PS4 Pro and PS4 VR models, the APP also receives videos, music & photos stored in a USB driver, on condition that the display supports up to 4K.
