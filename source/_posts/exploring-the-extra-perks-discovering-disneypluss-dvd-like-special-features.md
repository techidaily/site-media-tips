## Exploring the Extra Perks: Discovering Disney+'s DVD-Like Special Features!

### Key Takeaways

* Disney+ is full of special features like commentaries and sing-along versions.
* Bonus content is found under the "Extras" tab on the movie or show's page.
* Not everything has special features, but there are great options from Disney-owned studios.

 While you've probably eschewed physical media in favor of streaming, there's one thing that some DVDs and Blu-rays are great for: special features. When it's a movie or TV show you love, it's a joy to devour the likes of commentaries, deleted scenes, and outtakes. Well, Disney+ has your back.

 In the age of streaming, special features are mostly lost. On Netflix, you'll usually get a trailer, maybe a season recap if you're lucky. But did you know that Disney+ is full of special features?

##  How to Watch Extra Content on Disney+

 Whatever device you watch Disney+ on, be it your web browser, smart TV, or phone, the bonus content is in the same place. To find it, navigate to a show or movie, then switch to the "Extras" tab. If you don't see the tab, it means there are no special features.

 From there, simply select what you want to watch and it begins playing.

 Annoyingly, unlike regular content, your viewing progress isn't tracked. This means that if you don't watch it in a single sitting, it isn't added to the home screen's "Continue Watching" row, nor will it play from where you left off when you come back. As such, make a note of the time before you stop, then manually track forward to it when you return.

##  Does Everything on Disney+ Have Special Features?

 Not everything on Disney+ has special features. It's also not a given that just because the DVD or Blu-ray version has bonus content that it's on Disney+ (so [don't be afraid to buy your favorite shows on DVD](https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-from-nokia-105-classic-devices-by-drfone-android/)).

 Nevertheless, there's plenty to enjoy, especially if it's from a Disney-owned studio or brand like Pixar, Star Wars, and Marvel.

 If you're outside the US and have access to Star on Disney+, you'll find the extra content on these movies and shows more limited.

 Examples of great special features include:

* _Jungle Cruise Expedition Mode_, which gives fun facts related to the scene.
* _Frozen_'s sing-along version, which displays timed and color-coded lyrics.
* _Toy Story 4_'s insightful audio commentary from the director and one of the producers.

 There's far more to discover, so head to your favorite movie or show and see what's on offer. Personally, I love that _The Simpsons Movie_ has two different audio commentaries.

 One of the [improvements Disney+ could make](https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/024-approved-youtubes-top-tools-to-reduce-long-link-lengths/) is to add more bonus content, but I appreciate the selection it has nowâ€”especially compared to the other streaming services I subscribe to.
