## Slash Your Subscription Cost in Half - Secret Savings on Paramount+ Access Now Revealed!

All Paramount+ annual subscriptions are currently 50% off, meaning that you can score Paramount+ Essential for $30 or Paramount+ with SHOWTIME for $60\. This offer ends September 6th, so be sure to sign up today.

 You cannot redeem the 50% discount from the main Paramount+ site or mobile apps. Instead, you need to visit [a hidden deal page](https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/156932/175360/3065?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2005044&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F%3Fcbscidmt%3Dnfl) in your browser. This promotional offer is in anticipation of live local NFL ON CBS games, which are included in both tiers of the Paramount+ subscription.

* Paramount+ Essential: "Limited ads" with Paramount+ shows and movies, plus 24/7 CBS News, NFL on CBS, and UEFA Champions League.
* Paramount+ with SHOWTIME: Everything included in Essential, plus SHOWTIME originals, Live TV with CBS and PGA Tour, offline viewing, and ad-free on-demand content.

 If you redeem this offer, Paramount+ will automatically charge you the normal rate for your selected plan after one year. So, if you don't want to be charged $60 or $120 for Paramount+ in 2025, be sure to set a reminder to cancel on your calendar.

 It's worth pointing out that Paramount+ just [increased its monthly pricing](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-spy-on-text-messages-from-computer-and-nokia-g22-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). Those who currently pay month-to-month for a Paramount+ subscription should consider canceling and signing up for a discounted annual plan while this offer is still available. Annual pricing did not increase in 2024.

 Again, you must [redeem this offer](https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/156932/175360/3065?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2005044&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F%3Fcbscidmt%3Dnfl) at the hidden deal page, it doesn't appear in the website home page or apps. If it's not working, try copying and pasting the below URL in a new browser tab.

 Sign up before September 6th to secure the discounted pricing.
