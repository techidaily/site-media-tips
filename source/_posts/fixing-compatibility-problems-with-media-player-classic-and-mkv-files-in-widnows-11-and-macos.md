**★ Media Player Classic MKV No Video? \[Solved\]** 

_**Q:** "This is a bizarre occurrence. Was watching a file just earlier today and upon starting the next file, the screen only renders black (although proper size and aspect ratio) and only audio seems to play. It now seems to be doing this with all MKVs and AVIs" —from Blaque._

**A:** First, try to reset all settings (an option on the second page of the cccp settings application) and then change video renderer in Media Player Classic to Overlay (How to change video renderer: View menu, Options -> Playback/Output -> DirectShow Video section). If that doesn't work, please post up a COMPLETE CCCP Insurgent log. Not just snippets of one. And copy the entire text of the txt file that was saved (file -> save log).

**★ Media Player Classic MKV No Sound? \[Solved\]** 

_**Q:** "No sound on Media Player Classic? So I've just installed the K-lite Codec Pack. Now when I watch videos, there is no sound! Is there anyway I can fix this problem ASAP? Yup I've restarted after installing. Also, I've checked if the volume on the MPC was muted or low, it's not and also I watched a video on youtube to see if it was the speaker problem and it's not." —asdf from yahoo answer_

**A:** According to the question, it sounds like the codec pack didn't install correctly or was corrupted during download. So [download Media Player Classic codec](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) pack again and re-install. If that doesn't work, you may need to adjust the setting of the codec pack. 1\. Click on Start button, then go to All Programs -> K-Lite Codec Pack -> Configuration -> Codec Tweak Tool. 2\. In the Codec Tweak Tool window, tick the check box next to \[Registry\] fix non-working system sound. 3\. Click on the Next button, and your Media Player Classic MKV no sound problem should be fixed. If there is no problem about the codec pack, you just click View menu -> Options -> Output -> Audio renderer options and select Directsound.

**★ Media Player Classic MKV Lag? \[Solved\]** 

_**Q:** Lately, whenever I have been trying to play a 720p MKV file in Media Player Classic, it lags. Sometimes it plays without problems for about five or ten minutes, then it starts to lag. If I close and reopen the player or pause for a few minutes, the file will play smoothly again for a short period of time. This is only something that started a few weeks ago. Do I not have enough RAM (2.00 GB)?_

**A:** You should look at your task manager when it lags to see what is using up your resource. And you should also look at the memory and CPU usage and close the unnecessary programs. Or you can try uninstalling any recently installed programs and also removing your MKV encoders, drivers and players, then reinstalling. More advisably, find a [low CPU-cost MKV player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) to solve Media Player Classic MKV lag.

**★ Media Player Classic MKV Subtitles Not Showing? \[Solved\]** 

_**Q:** Currently I am trying to play an HD mkv file that has embedded subtitles. I have: installed. Everything works perfectly except I can't get the subtitles displayed in Media Player Classic. The tray icon for Haali Media Splitter even comes up and I can pick between subtitles or no subtitles, but either option, no subtitles are shown in Media Player Classic._ 

**A:** The subtitles are NOT embedded then, they are probably seperate files. To make the subs work with media player classic, make sure that output is set to VMR7/9\. View -> Options -> Playback -> Output -> DirectShow Video -> VMR7 (renderless) or VMR9 (renderless). Then when you play the file go to Navigate -> Subtitle Language. Complicated? You can dowload a [free subtitle player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) to play MKV files with subtitles.

If the solution provided above can't solve the Media Player Classic not playing MKV error, it probably means the MPC on your computer can't play MKV files properly. And it is highly recommended that you turn to a more considerate way-download Media Player Classic MKV alternative 5KPlayer to solve Media Player Classic MKV no video/image/no sound/lag etc errors once for all.
