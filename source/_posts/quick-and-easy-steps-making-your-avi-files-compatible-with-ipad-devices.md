## Part 1\. FAQ of converting MXF to MP4

### 1\. Why does MXF file disappear on Adobe Premiere?

[MXF](https://tools.techidaily.com/) \- Material Exchange Format is an open "container" or "wrapper" format, aimed at the interchange of audio-visual material with associated data and metadata. MXF is self-contained, holding complete content without need of external material and bundles together video, audio, and programmed data. MXF is fairly effective at the interchange of D10 (IMX) material and is used by more and more professional HD camcorders like Panasonic HVX200/HPX300, Sony XDCAM, and Canon XF105/XF300/XF300 to store video, audio, and programmed data. However, most of multimedia players, portable devices and video editing software cannot support MXF format very well.

 So you will find MXF file disappears when you try to read or play the MXF file on Adobe Premiere, VLC, iMovie, Handbrake, Final Cut Pro, Windows Movie Maker, etc. Some online sites don't support MXF upload, either.
