Apple Watch AirPlay is taking a bigger share in watchOS 2.1 released in September of 2015 and now Apple Watch Series 4 is avaliable too. Alongside the AirPlay Apple Watch function embedded in the Music App on Apple Wacth, a slew of other upgrades, such as an overhaul in Siri dictation, bunches of new Apple Watch APPs are all making the Apple Watch a more nifty wearable tool. With the Nylon version released making Apple Watch more affordable to us, today we walk you through of _**AirPlay Apple Watch**_ to make better use of the Apple Watch (Series 4).

Apple Watch (Series 4) can't go independently from iPhone to stream music — with the Bluetooth mode on, you can play the music on Apple Watch APP and get the music on iPhone.

This is because Apple Watch doesn't have its own [speaker](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) to listen to music. But is it possible to build connection between Apple Watch and Mac? By doing so, your Apple Watch is like a remote controller on your wrist that helps you step away and stay in control of the music playback. This is the time when you need [**5KPlayer**](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) that helps AirPlay from Apple Watch, because Apple Watch itself doesn't support streaming to Mac without third-party help. Find below as of how you can enable AirPlay.

**Step 3:** Force press the watch face, where you get four options including "Source" and "AirPlay", choose AirPlay  
**Step 4:** Choose your Mac name and the menu folds automatically, then hit the Play button.

By following the steps, Apple Watch Music will play on Mac via AirPlay
