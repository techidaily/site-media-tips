By doing so, your Apple Watch is like a remote controller on your wrist that helps you step away and stay in control of the music playback. This is the time when you need [**5KPlayer**](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) that helps AirPlay from Apple Watch, because Apple Watch itself doesn't support streaming to Mac without third-party help.
