 _Written by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: November 10, 2020 | 4 Mins Read_

Have got bored of playing games on iPhone with limited screen size? Even the biggest iPhone 11 Pro Max with display of 6.5 inches could not satisfy your needs? Or do you simply want to **play iOS game on PC** as you don't have a Mac computer with Apple Arcade installed to access various iOS games? To help you visually experience iPhone iPad games on PC computer with bigger screen, here suggests two ways. 

Out the market, there are commonly two ways to play iOS game on PC – [screen mirroring](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) and installing iOS emulator for PC. 

#### **Method 1\. Screen mirroring iOS to PC/Mac to display game contents**

Screen mirroring is the best way to display contents on one screen to another one, thus to achieve lossless device-to-device communication. It is usually wireless and occupies no storage. That is to say, there is no cable to tie you down and you can move to any place in your room to play iOS games on PC as long as you can see your PC screen. Also, you can play any types of games without worrying about your PC storage space. No matter **action games, adventure games, role-play games, simulation games, strategy games, sports games or puzzle games**, you have a lot freedom to play them on PC smoothly.

With Apple's AirPlay technology built-in, your iOS iPhone iPad has been ready to send the game contents to your computer. The only thing you need to do now is to make your PC AirPlay-enabled. Like what we have mentioned above, 5KPlayer is such a tool with great cross-platform compatibility to help receive iOS AirPlay mirroring contents and display the contents on PC flawlessly. It has been tested successfully to [play newest Apple Arcade games on PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/), so you can rest assured to play any iOS game in Apple App Store on PC without error. 

BTW, it is said that Apple's Intel to ARM transition movement will allow [run iOS apps on Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/), but the way is still to long if you want to play iPhone iPad games on Mac very smoothly. So, 5KPlayer is as of now a better choice.

#### **Method 2\. Install iOS emulator to create a virtual iOS system on PC**

The other way to play iPhone iPad games on PC is to install emulator software for PC, so as to make your PC system act as an iOS system to install iOS apps successfully.

**However,** after a try, we have found the installation process is quite complicated and most of them need payment for premium version. For example, the popular iOS emulator iPadian requires $10 for advanced service. Besides, most of them ask you to use iOS game apps from their own store, which means you can't access Apple's Store to get game apps. It doesn't matter as long as these iOS emulators' app stores have the same game resources as Apple's App Store, but disappointedly, they often have the availability of a limited number of apps. Worse still, most of the emulators are fake and they may install adware or malware to your computer. To sum up, if you want to use an iOS emulator to help play iOS game on PC, make sure the game is designed for the iOS emulator and you should also know there are no vast number of games for you to choose from.

Therefore, use AirPlay to screen mirroring Apple games to PC is highly suggested.
