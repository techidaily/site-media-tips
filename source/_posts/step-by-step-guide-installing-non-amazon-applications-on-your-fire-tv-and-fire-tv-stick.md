 First, go to Settings and choose "My Fire TV" or "Device & Software."

![Select &quot;My Fire TV.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2-fire-tv-menu.png?trim=1,1&amp;bg-color=000&amp;pad=1,1)

 You're all set! Now, we can go ahead and install apps from sources other than the Amazon Appstore.

##  How to Sideload Android Apps on Fire TV

 Before we can do anything, you'll need an APK to sideload, and we highly recommend using your phone for this part. You can [download APKs with some tools](https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/cover-film-noir-creating-vintage-scenes/) or use the [APK Mirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/) website, which is a trusted source for downloading apps. Just make sure to download APK files, not [app "bundles."](https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-the-artisans-guide-to-tiktok-captions-top-5-craftsmanship-strategies-for-2024/) 

 Next, we need to move the APK from your phone to the Fire TV. For that, we'll be using an app called "Send Files to TV." You'll need to [install the app on your TV](https://www.amazon.com/Send-files-to-TV-SFTTV/dp/B07QHFL8LK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU215968&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F336602%2Fhow-to-sideload-apps-on-the-fire-tv-and-fire-tv-stick%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) and [Android phone](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU215968/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yablio.sendfilestotv).
