## Free PotPlayer Mac Download Alternatives

 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

PotPlayer on Windows can let you change the playback speed, play back videos frame by frame and even allow you to create different sections of a video with different A-B playback loops. But sadly, Potplayer only supports Windows OS of 32/64 bit at present. So, if you are finding a player as feature rich as **PotPlayer for Mac**, you are at the right place! 

## Popular PotPlayer Mac Download Alternatives:

1\. **[VLC for Mac download](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/)**  
 VLC, this all platform compatible media player software, is boasted like the only one answer to all media questions. But is that so? Its ugly interface and occasional stuttering can never make a perfect match with your Macbook/iMac Pro. VLC's [HEVC 4K playback problem](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) is one of the most typical trouble you would run into. 

2\. **MPV media player mac download**: MPV player is media player software based on MPlayer and mplayer2\. It is by far one of the most active fork of MPlayer to provide solutions, updates, disscutions, etc. Its advanced upscaling filters, color management, and customizable pixel shaders as well as the decoding/encoding competence are really impressive. But we still prefer an elegant and morden build of a mac media player at first look.

3. **IINA for macOS Download**   
 IINA adopts the core engine of MPV so as to inherite MPV's great competence of decoding and image processing. Different from the slave mode of MPlayerX, IINA uses C API of libmpv to improve the speed and stability of image rendering and overall control. It renders images to original resolution of your screen. Currently confirmed to work on 10.13/high sierra, 10.11/el capitan and 10.10/yosemite. Since it is a newbie, it holds tons of hidden bugs and high possibility of unstable performance and system incompatibility.

4\. **QuickTime for Mac**  
 QuickTime player has very limited file format support compared to other PotPlayer mac alternatives. Its major problems like [Won't Play WMV Files on Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) and [Not Playing MP4 Files](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) are typically annoying.

5\. **MPlayerX for Mac**  
 This mac innate media player is frequently mentioned about when asking for great PotPlayer mac alternatives. However, its defects are obvious - based on obsolete mplayer with no further big updates or fixes while remaining a not-very-Mac styled user interface. Besides, MPlayerX works barely smoothly on El Capitan. It get [white screen problems](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) and other minor errors concerning pixels and playback interface.

Other decent Mac media players like GOM player, Plex and Eltima's Elmedia Player which can loop any part of video or audio file continuously and allow you to mark the favorite parts of a video or audio, are also worth trying out as the PotPlayer Mac alternative.
