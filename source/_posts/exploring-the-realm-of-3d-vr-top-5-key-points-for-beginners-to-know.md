![3D VR glasses](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/3d-vr-glasses.jpg) 

To put it short, a 3D VR movie captures all possibilities for your eyes, and your 3D VR glasses filters what you "see" by tracking the movements of eyeballs and head. So [what are the best VR and AR headsets?](http://www.wareable.com/headgear/the-best-ar-and-vr-headsets)

But that's a general definition of 3D VR glasses covering a full catalogue of lineups: Headsets like Oculus Rift works in conjunction with your PC once plugged in to its DVI or USB, the popular Google Cardboard relies on your iPhone/Android and Samsung Gear VR can work deftly only when you have a Samsung smart phone.

But one thing these VR 3D equipments share is the full-fledged sensors to offer head-tracking functionality, and a highly flexible refresh rate to cut lags.

#### ![](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/../seoimg/3.png) So we have the next problem:   **Why Do We Call It 3D VR, Does It Have Anything To Do With 3D Movies?**

Great question. Let's explain like this:

 In traditional 3D movies, 2 cameras capture images for your left/right eye respectively. When you put on a pair of red/cyan glasses, each eye sees the image prepared for it, thus creating a stereo, 3D video experience. But unlike 3D VR, you only get this feeling if you stare at the flat screen. OKay, words may not be straight-forward enough and you can [download 3D movies](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/) to give it a go.

However, when watching 3D VR movies, or playing 3D VR games, alongside the above-mentioned "immersive" and "interactive" experience as of left-to-right, you can raise eyes into the sky (or down to the ground) to find solid objects - the tagline difference between 3D VR and traditional 3D movies - when you look up above a 3D movie screen only to find the curtain or cinema wall.
