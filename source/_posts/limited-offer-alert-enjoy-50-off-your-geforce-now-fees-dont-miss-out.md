## Limited Offer Alert: Enjoy 50% Off Your GeForce NOW Fees - Don't Miss Out!

Now through August 18th, NVIDIA is offering 50% off its GeForce NOW Priority and Ultimate memberships. This discount applies to both 1-month and 6-month subscriptions.

 GeForce NOW delivers a desktop-class gaming experience to _any_ device. Even if you're using a Chromebook, an iPad, or a smart TV, GeForce NOW will let you stream games with ray-tracing at a high resolution and frame rate (up to 4K/240FPS).

 The [GeForce NOW Priority](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/#product-matrix) membership is more than enough for most people—you get six-hour gaming sessions (with unlimited sessions per day), a maximum 1080p resolution, RTX ray-tracing, and up to 60 FPS. A one-month Priority membership is just $5 during this Summer Sale, and you can score six months for $25.

 Paying for the [Ultimate membership](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/#product-matrix) gives you the experience of playing on an advanced RTX 4080 rig. Ultimate subscribers can enjoy 8-hour gaming sessions, a maximum 4K resolution, and a 240 FPS frame rate. One month of GeForce NOW Ultimate is $10 during this sale, while six months comes out to just $50.

 Many gamers still question the efficacy of GeForce NOW and other cloud gaming services. Ironically, reliability was never a problem in [our review](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-instagram-showcase-video-reversal-techniques-for-2024/) of GeForce NOW—the service worked perfectly, we just weren't in love with the price.

 The GeForce NOW Summer Sale is accompanied by nine newly-added games. Plus, users can now launch GeForce NOW from the Xbox Games web store.

* **The Crust** (New release on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1465470?utm%5Fsource=nvidia&utm%5Fcampaign=geforce%5Fnow), July 15)

* **Crime Boss: Rockay City** ([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933080?utm%5Fsource=nvidia&utm%5Fcampaign=geforce%5Fnow))

 I should take a moment to clarify that GeForce NOW _does not include_ any games. You must import your game library from a service like Steam, Xbox, EA, GOG, Ubisoft, or Epic Games.

 You can visit the [GeForce Now Games page](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/games/) to see a full list of titles that are supported by the cloud gaming service. Alternatively, set up a [free GeForce NOW account](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/#product-matrix), import your game libraries, and see which games will work. You can upgrade to a paid tier at the discounted price afterward.

 The [GeForce NOW Summer Sale](http://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/#product-matrix) ends August 18th. If you sign up for six months of the Priority membership, you'll save a total of $25\. Those savings increase to $60 with the discounted six-month Ultimate membership.
