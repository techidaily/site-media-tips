## How to Solve VLC AirPlay Not Working Issue?

 _Written by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21)_ | Last updated: April 30, 2020 

VLC 4's developers have been working on **VLC AirPlay** support for some time and it is confirmed that the feature will be included in the VLC 4 major version upgrade. "Just like with Chromecast, we intend to support AirPlay on any platform." This means that we can get an easier way to stream video and audio files from VLC media player on PC/phones/tablets to a big screen TV, without the need to install additional apps or purchase additional widgets. However, **VLC AirPlay not working issue** stands in the way of a smooth streaming experience every now and then.

## VLC AirPlay not working issue 1: VLC AirPlay not showing up, can't find AirPlay renderer

On Windows 10 PC, you might encounter the circumstances that iPhone and iPad find Apple TV renderer with no problem, but VLC gives the option of either "local" or grayed out "Scanning". VLC just cannot find Apple TV as AirPlay receiver. 

The problem can highly lie in Windows 10 update build 1803, which has managed to break some Apple Bonjour features. Even if you reinstall Bonjour 2.2, VLC AirPlay not working problem still remains.

**Solutions:**  
1\. Install Bonjour Print Service for Windows from Apple website instead of Bonjour 2.2;  
2\. Install VLC to "C:xxx" or any other folders, instead of under "C:\\program files\\xxx" and create firewall exceptions for VLC.   
3\. Also, VLC AirPlay not loading issue can also be resulted from WiFi routers, which can block multicast packets going from wired to wireless if your PC is at wired connection. In this case, your best defense is to buy high-quality APs from companies that care about making sure multicasts work.

## VLC AirPlay not working issue 2: Apple TV No Sound AirPlay from VLC 4

VLC AirPlay no sound on Apple TV issue can be, case 1, "volume still plays on the computer itself and does not transfer to the TV when watching a video"; case 2, Apple TV no sound at all during AirPlay. Make sure that sound level is set to the highest before you rush to preference settings.

For the first case, you might want to reset your core audio. On Mac, launch the terminal and enter the command: sudo killall coreaudiod and press Enter; on Windows and Apple TV, reboot your devices to restart audio drive.

For the second case, it can be a problem with Apple TV audio output setting. 

**Solutions:**  
1\. Go to Settings > Audio & Video on your Apple TV > Change the Audio Output setting from Auto to 16 bit  
2\. Change Dolby Digital Out setting: set to Off.

## VLC AirPlay not working issue 3: Apple TV Sound but No Picture AirPlay from VLC 4

 Restart your mobile device or computer.
