## Guide 2: How to Stream MKV to Chromecast

If you have the best gadget Chromecast, you can basically drag and drop the target video to Chrome browser and Chromecast it to TV. But you will find difficulty doing the same on MKV formats because most MKV files are encoded in a way that Chrome does not supports out of the box. So here are 2 quick tips that may help you if you already have tons of MKV files and want to stream those MKV videos to Chromecast. 

**Tip 1\. Rename the .mkv file to .mp4** 

Yes, it's just that easy! By directly changing the file extension from .mkv to .mp4, we may trick chrome to treat a mkv file as a mp4 file, thus it will play and Chromecast the MKV file smoothly. 

**Tip 2\. Install VLC Web Plugin**

If renaming doesn't work, you will need a proper media player plugin installed and enabled in your Chrome. The famous [VLC web plugin](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) is quite a good shot. Just follow us step by step：

1\. Download VLC media player from its official website;  
 2\. After the download completes, click the installer to view VLC setup wizard;  
 3\. Install VLC after checking all of the extensions and plug-ins;  
 4\. Open Chrome and type "chrome://plugins" in the browser to find the VLC web plugin.  
 5\. Click and select "Always Activate" to enable VLC web plugin for your Chrome.  
 After all done, do as you usually do to stream MKV to Chromecast.

## Guide: How to Stream MKV to Xbox 360

Surely Xbox 360 is a perfect platform to playback HD video. However, Xbox 360 has strict requirement for input formats and only WMV, AIV, H.264 and MPG-4 are compatible. That is to say it's impossible to directly stream MKV to Xbox 360 without the help of third party tool. Here we recommend DivX Media Server for MKV streaming. 

**Step 1:** Turn sharing on; Click "Media Server" button in the lower right corner of the Player, select "Setting" and hit "Turn Sharing On".

**Step 2:**[Add The Folders](http://divx.force.com/apex/Show%5FDivxB2C%5FArticle?id=kA1400000004NAi&language=en%5FUS&url=How-do-I-specify-what-folder-is-shared-in-the-DivX-Player-Media-Server) & to the DivX Media Server containing your .mkv files.

**Step 3:** Download and extract [FFmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) onto your system and then browse to correct path of ffmpeg.exe in the DivX Media Server Settings tab.

**Step 4:** Open the Xbox360 menu, navigate to the "tv & movies" section and choose "My Video Apps" and then "System Video Player".
