## Nintendo Switch: A Comprehensive Guide to Available Streaming Options

### Key Takeaways

* YouTube, Hulu, Crunchyroll, and Pokémon TV offer great entertainment options on Nintendo Switch.
* While Twitch was removed after originally being available, Netflix, Prime Video, and Disney+ ahave never been available on the Switch.

 With many titles and franchises to choose from, the Nintendo Switch is a great gaming machine. However, we all need a little break from gaming now and then. Luckily, the Switch has streaming apps that offer great passive entertainment.

##  YouTube

 YouTube has billions of videos ready to be consumed. No matter your interest, whether it's how-tos, gaming, comedy, beauty, fashion, technology, and fitness, there's a content creator for you.

 Most of YouTube's library is free, but you may run into ads on some of the videos. You can [subscribe to YouTube Premium](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-pinnacle-all-in-one-4k-with-touch-display/), which gives you an ad-free experience, starting from $13.99 per month. Furthermore, it allows you to unlock more content, such as YouTube original series and movies.

##  Hulu

 If you're a fan of movies and series, the Hulu app on Nintendo Switch is for you. The streaming service is known for its great Hulu Originals, including The Bear, Only Murders in the Building, The Handmaid's Tale, and PEN15.

 Furthermore, through partnerships with Disney (which owns it), Fox, Showtime, and other partners, there's an expansive library of great entertainment to enjoy. It has also partnered with BBC America, ABC, and ESPN+ to provide live news, sports, and entertainment.

 While the Hulu app is free to download on your Switch, you need a paid subscription to access its content. The basic plan with ads will set you back $7.99 per month. If you want to remove ads or add live TV channels, you'll have to pay more.

 If you are a new subscriber or an eligible returning customer, Hulu may offer you a one-month free trial to watch its movies and series.

##  Crunchyroll

 You can catch up on your favorite anime with the Crunchyroll app on Nintendo Switch. [Crunchyroll has a ton of anime](https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-resolve-samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-screen-not-working-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/), including modern titles like Attack on Titan, Demon Slayer, and Jujutsu Kaisen. You can also find classic anime here, such as Dragon Ball Z, One Piece, and Cowboy Bebop.

 What makes Crunchyroll great is its simulcasts. This means you can watch the latest ongoing anime as it airs in Japan—no need to wait. You can watch anime for free with some limitations (ads and premium locked episodes), on other platforms (PC, Android, and iOS). But, unfortunately, the Nintendo Switch app only works with the premium plans.

 Luckily, there's a two-week free trial period that works with the Switch app if you're a new subscriber. Afterward, you can subscribe to the premium plan, starting at $7.99 per month.

##  Pokémon TV

 With the Pokémon TV app, fans of the popular Nintendo franchise can watch curated Pokémon content for free. This includes specials, movies, episodes, and even entire seasons of the Pokémon anime. It's a chance to relive or discover some of Ash's greatest adventures and classic battles.

 Furthermore, the app includes Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) tips and strategies. You can also watch Pokémon TCG tournaments worldwide right on your Switch.

 Don't be disappointed by the limited selection of streaming apps on the Nintendo Switch. Whether you have the [original Switch, OLED, or Lite](https://win11.techidaily.com/1719355296197-dimming-windows-11-brightness-simple-fixes-unveiled/), remember it's primarily a gaming console. You shouldn't expect it to have a wide range of streaming apps like TVs and Smartphones.

 And if you're looking at these streaming apps because you don't play games but happen to have a Switch, there are some [beginner-friendly games you can try](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/in-2024-comparison-of-googles-ar-embellishments-to-competitors/).
