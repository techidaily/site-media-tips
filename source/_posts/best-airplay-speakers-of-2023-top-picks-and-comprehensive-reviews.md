Require a JBL Music Flow mobile APP to control remotely

**Pros:** L8 AirPlay audio receiver is revolutionary, it's probably the best ever speaker that cuts off all wires, cables or strings, just as is described "Leave those tangled wires in the attic where they belong". It's somewhat difficult to relate JBL L8 to its performance by looking at its cliche design, yet it's just such a blend of the legendary JBL Century L100 and the cutting-edge AirPlay audio streaming technology, and integrates them well. Indeed, cost for this AirPlay audio receiver isn't really friendly, but most users wouldn't think so by the time they unbox the wooden-enclosed speaker, and installed the free JBL music flow APP to remotely decide the music playback from an Android or iOS device. JBL AirPlay audio receiver has the transducers and acoustic design that can deliver amazing sound from a compact speaker. It's also one-point better than the rest of the speaker with its automatic format conversion capability, working with any music formay that you throw at it.
