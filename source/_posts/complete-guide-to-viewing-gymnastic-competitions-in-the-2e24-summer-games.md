 If you're like many Americans, you're looking forward to watching the gymnastics portion of the Paris 2024 Olympics. It's the most watched event, followed closely by swimming. There are two platforms you can use to watch this year, and we'll tell you how.

##  How Many Gymnastics Events are in the Olympics?

 Gymnastics have been a part of the Olympic Games since the beginning, though women only began competing at the 1928 games. At the 2024 games in Paris, there will be _14 events_ in total:

* **Women**: Team, individual all-around, uneven bars, balance beam, vault, floor exercise
* **Men**: Team, individual all-around, floor exercise, high bar, vault, still rings, pommel horse, parallel bars

 Certain countries, including Romania, China, and the U.S., tend to dominate the sportâ€”but nations like Japan and Great Britain are on their heels.

##  When are the Gymnastics Airing in the Paris Olympics?

 Gymnastics will air between July 27th and August 5th. The first two days are qualifying rounds, followed by the team finals and all-around finals. The individual events take place last and begin on August 3rd.

 You can find the full schedule on the [official Olympics website](https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/schedule/artistic-gymnastics?day=27-july).

 The Olympics are being covered by NBC this year. That includes your local NBC affiliate, plus the [Peacock app](https://www.peacocktv.com/). In fact, Peacock will have every single event, and it is introducing a four-view experience that lets you watch up to four events simultaneously.

 You can create a custom event list on Peacock by going to the Olympics Schedule within the app. Once you add Gymnastics events to "My Stuff," it will be easier to find them in the future.

 NBC will air a variety of events in primetime, including a lot of gymnastics event coverage.

##  Is There Any Way to Watch the 2024 Olympics for Free?

 Unfortunately, there is no way to get Peacock for free. But you can [get NBC for free with an OTA antenna](https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-a-non-functioning-steelseries-arctis-pro-microphone-complete-solution/) if you have [access to your NBC affiliate at your address](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-crossing-platforms-upload-video-to-twittertumblr/) (signal strength can vary based on location). You could also watch NBC coverage by getting a 7-day free trial from a live TV streamer like [Fubo](https://www.fubo.tv/). If you signed up on July 30th, you would have the streamer through the end of the individual medal ceremonies.
