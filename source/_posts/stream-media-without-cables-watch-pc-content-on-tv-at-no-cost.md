 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

Watching video streams on PC is the past, increasingly more people are watching video streams directly from TV set for more comfortable and theater level enjoyment. Then how about those DVDs and PC downloaded videos? How about iTunes purchased movies? Can they be streamed to TV from PC and how?

5KPlayer provides two streaming methods for you to beam movies from PC to TV set - **AirPlay and DLNA,**  to stream as many movies, videos, clips as possible, be it iTunes purchases, digitalized DVDs, recordings, etc.   
 If you are an Apple user using Apple TV, then choose AirPlay to stream content from PC to TV. If you do not have an Apple TV but a samsung smart TV, then choose DLNA.
