Watching video streams on PC is the past, increasingly more people are watching video streams directly from TV set for more comfortable and theater level enjoyment. Then how about those DVDs and PC downloaded videos? How about iTunes purchased movies? Can they be streamed to TV from PC and how?

5KPlayer provides two streaming methods for you to beam movies from PC to TV set - **AirPlay and DLNA,**  to stream as many movies, videos, clips as possible, be it iTunes purchases, digitalized DVDs, recordings, etc.   
 If you are an Apple user using Apple TV, then choose AirPlay to stream content from PC to TV. If you do not have an Apple TV but a samsung smart TV, then choose DLNA.

## How to Free Stream Videos from PC to TV via DLNA?

Note: Check and make sure that your video format is supported by TV set before streaming from PC. If not, use [converter software](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) to convert the video into TV compatible formats.  
 Also make sure that your smart TV and your PC are connected the same Wi-Fi networkso as to [turn your computer into a DLNA media server](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/dlna/).

**Step 1**: Free download this [PC to TV streamer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) on your computer and run it.  
 Make sure that your PC and TV are connected the same WIFI network.

**Step 2**: To b>stream from PC to TV, you need to click the "AirPlay" icon on the top right corner first. And then choose "Apple TV" from the drop-down menu. 

The icon would turn red if successfully enabled.
