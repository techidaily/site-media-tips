## Currently **5KPlayer** Supports DLNA Streaming & AirPlay Mirroring

Official Clarification: Since Apple has strengthened the "sign & countersign" for AirPlay Bonjour protocol, 5KPlayer for Windows does not support movie/music AirPlay at present.

We have been working hard on AirPlay streaming to figure out a solution. Please stay with us and trust our dedication and efforts! AirPlay for Windows will be back soon!

### How to Solve 5KPlayer Not Responding Problem

5KPlayer Not Responding error message occurs often in the middle of a video or a DVD playback, the whole 5KPlayer playback window will go blank and the "5KPlayer Not Responding" message will pop up. 

#### **There are two possibilities that we've tested to cause such an error:**

![Slove 5KPlayer not Working problem](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/5kp-not-working.jpg)

☆ The video or the DVD you are watching is incomplete or partly broken.   
**Solution:** you can test if it is realy the problem of 5KPlayer or the video clip by playing the same clip with another video player such as VLC. And if it is the problem of the clip then all you have to do is to get a complete and unbroken video.

 ☆ 5KPlayer is in conflict with another App running on your computer.   
**Solution:** The same problem happened to me personally as well, so I eliminated down to the specific app that was in conflict with 5KPlayer and exit the program and 5KPlayer worked perfectly again, but be sure to close 5KPlayer and relaunch it.

**Note:** 5KPlayer is able to play 180+ video formats and 60+ audio formats, such as MKV, AVI, MP4, WMV, FLV, MP3, AAC, APE and FLAC, play DVDs (even with region codes and copy protections), so it would be the least possible reason that 5KPlayer failed to play your video formats, but if you are playing Blu-ray or the rare or old-fashioned video files such as WFS, I'm sorry that none of the mainstream video player can play that.

###  How to Solve 5KPlayer YouTube Analyze Not Working

There are 3 possible reasons which leads 5KPlayer analyze video URL failed:

![Slove 5KPlayer YouTube Download not Working problem](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/5kplayer-downloader-not-working.jpg)

☆ 5KPlayer does not download videos from the website you are suggesting.   
**Solution:** All the video hosting sites that 5KPlayer supports such as YouTube, Vevo, Dailymotion are listed in the 300+ [online sites list](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/). Of course 5KPlayer is working on to explore more and be able to support more sites in the future but in the mean time, it does not support to download videos from all sites natively. So, if you really want to download the specific video online, try to find it on the website that 5KPlayer supports. 

 ☆ Some video sites are constantly updating their algorithm and 5KPlayer sometimes failed to decode in time as it needs time to auto-update itself. 

**Solution:** We set that 5KPlayer will be automatically update itself in 10 minutes after everytime it is opended, so if this is the reason, you can just simply wait for a few minutes after open 5KPlayer and then you will be able to download Dailymotion, Facebook videos again. 

 ☆ **VPN Problem:** For some users who needs a private poxy (VPN) to access the video hosting site such as YouTube, you need to make sure that the VPN you applied is also App friendly. For some extension VPN services, they just allows you to access the website across the firewall, but not the apps. Due to the fact that 5KPlayer is a standalone freeware on your Mac and PC, it needs a proper VPN to download Dailymotion videos or download videos from any other website that you need VPN to access.

###  How to Solve 5KPlayer AirPlay Not Working

Notice: 5KPlayer recently had removed video music AirPlay function in 4.5 version for a great improvement that will come soon, but the mirroring function is still there. If you do need to AirPlay the video or music, you can use the older version of 5KPlayer.

5KPlayer offers an easy way to turn your Mac or PC as free [AirPlay sender](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) and AirPlay receiver to stream movies and music from iPad, iPhone and iPod to Mac and PC or stream video/music from Mac/PC to Apple TV, or between Macs and PCs. But sometimes the AirPlay function not working is because: 

☆   **The video/music files you want to stream is not AirPlay compatible**   
Apple AirPlay only natively supports the video in MP4, MOV and M4V, and music in MP3\. If you intend to AirPlay a DVD or the files not included in AirPlay compatible formats, you might wanna convert those video files with an excellent video converter or DVD ripper, then you can [stream MKV to Apple TV](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/)or [AirPlay DVD](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/)． 

☆ **There are also some preperations need to be done before AirPlay**  
 First, make sure that your computer which installed 5KPlayer is on the same network as the desired device you want to stream from/to, be it iPhone, iPad or another Mac/PC or Apple TV.   
 Second, if you want to AirPlay between Macs and PCs, you have to make sure the other computer is also installed with 5KPlayer and it is open.
