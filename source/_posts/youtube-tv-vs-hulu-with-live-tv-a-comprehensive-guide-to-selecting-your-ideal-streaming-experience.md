### Key Takeaways

* Despite a slightly clunky TV app, Hulu (+Live TV) is the best option for most people due to its various pricing plans, superior content library, and inclusion of ESPN+ and Disney+.
* YouTube TV is marginally cheaper with a cleaner interface and better account sharing options, but lacks the original content and partnerships with other major services.

 Streaming services can replace your traditional cable service, and you may not have to give up your favorite channels to make the change. Hulu (+ Live TV) and YouTube TV are two popular options. Hulu has the better library, but YouTube TV gives it a run for its money. So which should you choose?

##  Pricing, Plans, and Trials

| |  **Monthly Cost**  | **Number of Channels** | **Free Trial** | **Multiple Plans** | **DVR Storage** |           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | --------- |
| **Hulu (+ Live TV)** | $76.99                 | 90+            | No                 | Yes             | Unlimited |
| **YouTube TV**       | $72.99                 | 100+           | Yes                | No              | Unlimited |

 The two services have comparable pricing plans. However, [Hulu (+ Live TV)](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/still-using-pattern-locks-with-oppo-find-x7-tips-tricks-and-helpful-advice-by-drfone-android/) offers more options. The base plan includes on-demand content with ads at $76.99 per month. For $89.99 per month, you can eliminate the ads on your on-demand Hulu content. If you only want live TV and not the library, you can shave a dollar off the price and pay just $75.99 per month.

[YouTube TV](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-real-time-voice-to-action-no-price-tag/) has just one plan, available at $72.99 per month, that always includes ads. Making matters worse, [YouTube's ads are getting longer than they used to be](https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/swift-switcheroo-rearranging-yt-lists-in-a-minute/). Hulu never offers a free trial for its service, while YouTube TV sometimes runs free trial promotions that last several weeks. When those promotions are not active, the platform lets you test drive YouTube TV for 20 minutes before you have to officially sign up.

##  Live Content

 Ditching your traditional cable subscription for a digital streaming service is only worth it if you can still catch your favorite shows and live events. Luckily, both YouTube TV and Hulu (+ Live TV) both carry a significant number of channels in most markets.

 YouTube TV advertises more than 100 channels.

![YouTube TV partial channel list.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/youtube-tv-channels.jpg) 

 Hulu (+ Live TV) promises upwards of 90 channels.

![Hulu Live TV partial channel list.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/hulu-channel-list.jpg) 

 The exact lineup may vary based on location: You can enter your zip code on each platform's website to see which networks are available in your area.

 While YouTube TV has more channels, the Hulu (+ Live TV) plan includes live programming on ESPN+ at no additional cost. Once you sign up for Hulu, just use your same login credentials to sign in on the ESPN app (available on mobile devices and smart TVs).

 Despite its lack of ESPN+ coverage, YouTube TV may still be a good fit for sports fans. It is the exclusive home of the NFL Sunday Ticket (available at an additional cost). YouTube TV also has NBA TV, which Hulu (+ Live TV) does not.

 Hulu (+ Live TV) includes Disney+ content in all plans. Hulu and Disney+ have historically been two separate apps, but a new app is forthcoming in 2024 that will [combine both Hulu and Disney+ libraries](https://program-issues.techidaily.com/expert-advice-how-to-stop-nioh-2-complete-from-crashing-on-your-pcconsole/).

 Both platforms offer major networks, like NBC, CBS, and ABC. They also have extended cable networks that include: Bravo, CNN, ESPN, FX, NFL Network, TBS, and USA. Both platforms also allow you to get premium channels like HBO and SHOWTIME by purchasing an add-on.

##  On-Demand Content

 Hulu has a better on-demand library than YouTube TV. Not only does Hulu have content from major networks like ABC and FOX, but it also features a lot of original series and movies. Hulu Originals include _Only Murders in the Building_, _The Bear_, _Reservation Dogs_, and _The Other Black Girl_.

![Hulu original shows and movies screen.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/hulu-originals.jpg) 

 If you like to binge on the weekends, and you want to be a part of water cooler conversations about viral shows, Hulu's library is just better at keeping you in the loop.

 That being said, YouTube TV still has on-demand shows to scroll through. You'll mostly find episodes from the latest seasons of network shows, but some full seasons are available. YouTube TV has some movies on demand as well. Ad-supported movies include: _Clueless_, _Catch Me If You Can_, and _Arrival_.

 YouTube TV doesn't have any original programming.

##  User Experience

 If you already have Hulu, live channels are added to your current account in the left-hand menu on TVs and the bottom menu on your mobile app. That part is easy. However, the Hulu (+ Live TV) guide for TVs isn't as intuitive as it could be.

 When you choose Live from the main Hulu menu on a TV, you land on the most recently accessed channel. Then, you have to choose the Down arrow to bring up the guide and main menu on the left side of the screen. You'll see Recent, Channels, Favorites, Sports, Movies, and Kids options in the menu.

 If you want to go to a recently accessed channel, for instance, you have to go Left to access the menu and scroll to Recent. Then, once you make the selection, you need to navigate Right to get back to the channel list and look for the network you want. If it sounds like a video game, it kind of feels like one, too.

 When you want to add a channel to your favorites list, you have to go to the channel and add it to your My Stuff list. All channels are listed alphabetically, even local channels, which can be annoying at times.

 Scrolling to the tab and channel that you want is a little easier on a laptop, where the menus remain at the top of the screen.

![Hulu home screen with channel grid.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/hulu-channel-list-screen.jpg) 

 YouTube TV gives you an easier user experience in many ways. The home screen just has three options along the top: Library, Home, and Live. The Home screen offers viewing suggestions based on your viewing history and lets you resume watching on-demand or DVR content that you haven't finished.

![YouTube TV home screen with tabs.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/youtube-tv-home-screen.jpg) 

 The Live tab on YouTube TV gives you your live TV grid. You can rearrange the channels here so that your most used networks appear first. The only downside is that you have to do this on a computer. Still, changing the channel order can make it a lot easier to access your favorite channels. You can also remove networks you never watch from your channel grid altogether.

 To remove a channel on YouTube TV, log into your account on a computer and go to Settings > Live Guide. Simply uncheck the box next to any channels you don't want to see in your channel list.

 In the end, both Hulu (+ Live TV) and YouTube TV have a decent user experience, but YouTube TV's may be easier to get used to.

##  Password Sharing

 Because Hulu makes you choose a home network, [it's not possible to share your Hulu password](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-strategizing-your-approach-highlight-and-story-downloads/) with anyone living outside your area. Hulu (+ Live TV) lets you change your home location just four times per year. After that, it stays locked into the current network until your new membership year begins. This makes it unfeasible to share with someone on another internet network.

 The one exception is mobile viewing. If you have a friend or family member who signs in to Hulu using your password while on your home network, they will be able to watch from anywhere for 30 days.

 YouTube TV isn't so strict about sharing your account. You can add someone to a family group and let them use your account easily. To share your account, go to Settings > Family Sharing > Set Up. If you provide an email address for your family member or friend, they will receive an email invite to log in to your YouTube TV account. They will need to use their own Google account.

---

 The bottom line? If you already have and love Hulu, adding Live TV is simple and you'll get tons of channels. Plus, you get all Disney content you can't get anywhere else. On the other hand, if you're new to streaming, YouTube TV is easier to use in many ways and you get more channels with easier account sharing.
