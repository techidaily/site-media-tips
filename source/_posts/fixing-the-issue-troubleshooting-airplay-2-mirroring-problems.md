## AirPlay 2 vs AirPlay

Before jumping to solutions, we should first understand about [AirPlay 2 in comparison with AirPlay 1.0](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/)

AirPlay 2 is only elevated from AirPlay 1.0 from the below aspect - Multi-device multi-audio streaming simultaneously controlled from one center - your iOS device. This means that you can control the multi-audio streaming playbacks on several different speakers respectively from one end. This even includes Apple TV connected speakers which are not AirPlay compatible.

_Note that Apple TV when running tvOS 11.4 will be compatible with AirPlay 2 protocol. iPhone 5S, iPad Air, and iPad mini 2 that can update to iOS 11.4 are privileged to AirPlay 2.0\._ 

Sadly, Apple hasn't adopted a multi-screen mirroring feature for AirPlay 2 mirroring, or multi-video streaming feature in response to the multi-audio streaming utility. The actual AirPlay 2 mirroring is no different from the original AirPlay mirroring working mechanism. And as usual, we can only mirroring our screen in a one-on-one manner. The iOS screen mirroring function stays as it was without change in this 2.0 upgrade. 

Therefore, if your iPhone X is upgraded to iOS 11.4 with AirPlay 2 supported yet your Apple TV is the old 2nd gen without tvOS 11.4 update, AirPlay 2 is impossible to run. And your AirPlay connection will only fall back to the first gen AirPlay protocol for streaming and AirPlay mirroring.
