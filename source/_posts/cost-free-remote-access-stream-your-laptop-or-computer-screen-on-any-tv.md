**2\. Desktop Sharing via Chromecast Mirroring**

Google's Chromecast also offers a user-friendly way to let you [cast your computer's screen contents to your TV](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) wirelessly. To get desktop sharing started, you obviously need a Chromecast. At the same time, you should install the "Google Cast Extension" in your Chrome browser. All done, just click the "Google Cast" in your Chrome and choose "Cast screen/window".

**Note:** Google still marks Chromecast screen feature as "experimental", and how well it works will depend on how powerful your computer is, your Wi-Fi condition, etc.

**3\. Desktop Sharing via HDMI Cable** 

HDMI cable is also a good way to mirror your PC desktop to a TV. Theoretically, what you need to do is to connect your TV HDMI port and computer HDMI port using the cable and switch the TV to "HDMI" input. But in practice, many modern laptops, from Apple's MacBooks to Microsoft's Surface Pros, don't have any HDMI port but a "[Mini DisplayPort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini%5FDisplayPort)". In this case, you will need a necessary adapter to do desktop sharing.

**In conclusion:**

When it comes to desktop sharing, Airplay works more stable than Chromecast does. As for the wired method, although it is the most reliable, the problem is that you have to place your computer close to your TV for most HDMI cables are only six to ten feet long. So, sharing your desktop with Airplay is still the king.
