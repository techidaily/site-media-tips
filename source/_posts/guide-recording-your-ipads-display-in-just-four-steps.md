### 4 Ways to Screen Record iPad Contents

#### **Method 1\. Using the Screen Recording Function Built in iPad**

iPad with iOS 11 or later and iPadOS has an embedded screen recorder that you can use to screen record iPad with sound. It is quite convenient to capture any operations quickly without need to open a third-party screen recorder app. However, you may have to jump to the below ways as this method is only available for somewhat new iPad models.

**Step 1\. Add iPad screen recording function to Control Center**  
 Go to Settings > Control Center > Customizable Controls > tap the "plus" icon ![](https://www.5kplayer.com/airplay/img/plus-icon.jpg) next to Screen Recording to add it to Control Center > Go back to the UI of iPad

**Step 2\. Activate iPad screen recording**  
 1\. Swipe up from the bottom of any screen if you have an iOS 11 iPad, or swipe down from the upper-right corner of the screen if you have an iPad with iOS 12 or iPadOS.  
 2\. Firm press the icon ![](https://www.5kplayer.com/airplay/img/record-icon-1.jpg) and tap Microphone to turn on it if you want to screen recording iPad with sound or turn off it to record no sound. Here, you can also choose a different destination for the screen recording other than the Photos library.  
 3\. Tap Start Recording, and wait for the three-second countdown.
