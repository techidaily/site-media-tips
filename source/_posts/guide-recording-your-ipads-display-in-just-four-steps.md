 1\. Swipe up from the bottom of any screen if you have an iOS 11 iPad, or swipe down from the upper-right corner of the screen if you have an iPad with iOS 12 or iPadOS.  
 2\. Firm press the icon ![](https://www.5kplayer.com/airplay/img/record-icon-1.jpg) and tap Microphone to turn on it if you want to screen recording iPad with sound or turn off it to record no sound.
