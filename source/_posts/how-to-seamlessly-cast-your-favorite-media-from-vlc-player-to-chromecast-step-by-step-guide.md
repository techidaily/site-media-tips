BTW, you can change VLC Chromecast output quality to decrease the loading time of the video on your TV screen: Tools > Preferences > All in the Show settings > expand Sout stream under Stream output > Chromecast > choose the Conversion quality in the right part from the drop down menu.

### How to Enable VLC Android/iOS Chromecast?

Then, connect your mobile device and Chromecast device to the same WiFi network. Now, you can play the media file on your mobile device and tap on the Chromecast button in the VLC app to start casting VLC to Chromecast.

You can also have many options on your mobile device to control the media playback on your Chromecast TV, like subtitle sync, jump to a chapter, change the playback speed. If you want to stop VLC Chromecast on Android or iOS, just press the back button and return to VLC's main screen.

### How to Solve VLC Media Player Chromecast not Working?

Despite VLC Chromecast feature is in the stable version of VLC media player, it still needs development. Some people has reported that this feature doesn't work perfectly for them and has some problems like missed frames during playback, audio de-synced, no video audio only, no Chromecast device showing up, black screen, etc. To solve the kinds of [Chromecast not working](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) errors, you may try the following methods.

1\. Please satisfy the basic requirements as we mentioned above before activating VLC Chromecast: up-to-date version of VLC, Chromecast-supported device and the same network.

2\. VLC media player has support for a variety of file formats including MKV, MP4, FLV, MP3 and WMA, but if you see "Performance warning" notification and nothing is playing on the Chromecast device, the media file you are trying to play maybe not compatible with VLC. Just click on OK to convert the file to VLC supported format to go on casting.

Besides that, you have to make sure that the media format is also supported by Chromecast. The default Chromecast video formats are MP4 and WebM, and it can also supports MPEG-DASH, Smooth Streaming and [HTTP Live Streaming](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) (HLS) media files. All other video formats are not supported like MKV, VOB, FLV, AVI, MOV, 3G2, M2TS, 3GP, Divx, RMVB, ASF, TS, F4V, etc. So, if you want to stream these media files from VLC to Chromecast, you'd better convert the file to MP4 with a [video converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/).

3\. If your Chromecast device is not showing up in the list of Renderer of VLC, you can go to Tools > Preferences and click on the "Reset Preferences" button. This is a quite easy way to solve the problem when you lose your preferences.

4\. You can also stream video audio from VLC to Chromecast via Google Chrome's built-in casting tool. Simply open Chrome to any website > right click on the webpage to choose "Castâ€¦" > after Google Chrome searching for the Chromecast device, just choose your device > when Chromcast is broadcasting the whole screen, just open VLC media player and play your media file in full screen. This is also a good way to cast VLC to Chromecast successfully. However, as Chromecast video streaming protocol is more focused on speed rather than quality, the video quality would be much lower than the standard VLC Chromecast method.
