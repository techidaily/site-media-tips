The overall procedures are laid out with a click on the bigger AirPlay icon on the middle right.   
 • Go to Preference > AirPlay > On. Name and password can also be specified here. It's best to set a password so people can't just start sending content to your screen in public places, such as a coffee shop or library.  
 • Or tap AirPlay icon on the top right of the main interface, or tap the AirPlay icon beside the progress bar while video or audio is playing, the icon will turn from dark to bright after successfully activated.
