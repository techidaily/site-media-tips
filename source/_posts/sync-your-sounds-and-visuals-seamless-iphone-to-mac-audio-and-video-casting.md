## How to AirPlay Prerequisites:

**1\. iOS 4.3 or higher**

AirPlay requires an Apple TV (2nd generation or later) with an iOS device running iOS 4.3 or later or a Mac with iTunes 10.2 or later, which means that only when you have updated your iPhone to iOS 4.3 or newer, can you AirPlay from your iPhone to Mac or Apple TV with requested configurations.

**2\. Connect to the same WIFI network**

Make sure that your iPhone and your AirPlay target device, for instance Macbook Pro, are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Note that **Peer-to-peer AirPlay** requires your iOS device (late 2012 or later) with iOS 8, which cannot be achieved by iPhone 4.
