## 2019 VLC Media Player Alternatives for Windows Free Download

 _Written by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21)_ | Last updated: April 30, 2020 

"**What is the best media player for Windows, besides VLC?**" as requested by Quora users. I start writing this review with test details, to somehow explore the VLC Windows alternative question. 

As VLC, the "swiss-army-knife" media player, is widely renowned as the best/universal media player of all, why would we still need to get a VLC alternative on Windows/macOS? The sad fact is that, VLC for Windows is not as all-round superb as generally praised, and none of the media players can be. They run into troubles just a matter of time. And Media player alternatives would always be in need as long as one of them crashes with another proping up for instant support, as a life saver. The more back up solutions, the better. And that's why i myself have at least three media players installed on each single Windows computer. 

What am I going to do here today is to test out the playback ability of frequently used four players - **GOMplayer, Potplayer, VLC and KMplayer** in regard of four typical videos, be it a iPhone X recorded slow-mo video, a 360-deg video, a 4K video as well as an 8K 8-bit video.

With above test details given, let's throw videos at those "overbloated" media players and see if they are truly worthy of the praises.

## Part 2: VLC Alternatives for Windows 8K Video Playback Test

#### **VLC 3.0.4 Vetinari for Windows** \- 8K video playback quality and CPU usage **\[#4\]**

Note that video output was set "Automatic", and it auto choosed Direct3D9\.

#### **KMplayer 2018.10.7.14 for Windows** \- 8K video playback quality and CPU usage **\[#1\]**

![VLC 8K Video Playback Test](https://www.5kplayer.com/vlc/img/km-8k.jpg) 

#### **PotPlayer 1.7.14804 for Windows** \- 8K video playback quality and CPU usage **\[#2\]**

![VLC 8K Video Playback Test](https://www.5kplayer.com/vlc/img/pot-8k.jpg) 

#### **GOMplayer 2.3.34.5295 for Windows** \- 8K video playback quality and CPU usage **\[#3\]**

![VLC 8K Video Playback Test](https://www.5kplayer.com/vlc/img/gom-8k.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Verdict:**   
 Clearly seen from the above 8K video playback quality of each tested media player, VLC 3.0.4 was apparently rather an 8K disaster! My computer was like screaming in ultrasonic wave during the "color powder" playback, while the CPU usage suddenly surged to 95! Yet, could not see a thing! 

 Generally, **KMplayer**, **PotPlayer** and **GOMplayer** are the winner and the runner-ups in this round, delivering smoother and crystal clear images at relatively low CPU consumptions in comparison with VLC on Windows. 

KMPlayer playback control bar freezes and you cannot pause/resume the video. While potplayer dishes better control - pause/resume/fullscreen/ etc, yet choppy sound.

## Part 3: VLC Alternatives for Windows 4K HDR Playback Test

#### **VLC 3.0.4 Vetinari for Windows** \- 4K HDR video playback quality and CPU usage **\[#4\]**

VLC media player was going choppy at first, but given time, it gradually fell in the tune with the video and started to read it, but still in a poorly manner at an alarming high CPU usage of 90\. 

![VLC 4K Video Playback Test](https://www.5kplayer.com/vlc/img/vlc-4k.jpg) 

#### **KMplayer 2018.10.7.14 for Windows** \- 4K HDR video playback quality and CPU usage **\[#2\]**

![Windows VLC Alternative 4K Playback](https://www.5kplayer.com/vlc/img/km-4k.jpg) 

#### **PotPlayer 1.7.14804 for Windows** \- 4K HDR video playback quality and CPU usage **\[#1\]**

![Windows VLC Alternative 4K Playback](https://www.5kplayer.com/vlc/img/pot-4k.jpg) 

#### **GOMplayer 2.3.34.5295 for Windows** \- 4K HDR video playback quality and CPU usage **\[#3\]**

![Windows VLC Alternative 4K Playback](https://www.5kplayer.com/vlc/img/gom-4k.jpg) 

**Verdict:**  
 GOMplayer secretely jumps frames and is slow at starting, but even so, it is still more capable of processing 4K HDR video than VLC in terms of video output quality. PotPlayer delivers constant and relatively smooth visuals as it is with KMplayer, only that PotPlayer takes a higher CPU usage of about 86% while KMPlayer's control bar stays unmoved. The best 4K HDR video player goes to both **KMPlayer** and **Potplayer** in this round. 

## Part 4: VLC Alternatives for Windows SlowMo Playback Test

#### **VLC 3.0.4 Vetinari for Windows** \- Slowmo video playback quality and CPU usage **\[#4\]**

The CPU usage of VLC as well as of all the other players are alarmingly high throughout this tests, and the visuals varies and are not as good as expected. VLC in particular stuck at the first frame and you could only see the playback bar moving without changing to the corresponding frames.

#### **KMplayer 2018.10.7.14 for Windows** \- Slowmo video playback quality and CPU usage **\[#1\]**

KMPlayer was doing good in slow-motion video playback. It reads the video as if it was played on iPhone. 

![Windows VLC Alternative Slowmotion Playback](https://www.5kplayer.com/vlc/img/km-slmo.jpg) 

#### **PotPlayer 1.7.14804 for Windows** \- Slowmo video playback quality and CPU usage **\[#2\]**

VLC media player was going choppy at first, but given time, it gradually fell in the tune with the video and started to read it, but still in a poorly manner at an alarming high CPU usage of 90\.

#### **GOMplayer 2.3.34.5295 for Windows** \- Slowmo video playback quality and CPU usage **\[#3\]**

![Windows VLC Alternative Slowmotion Playback](https://www.5kplayer.com/vlc/img/gom-slmo.jpg)

**Verdict:**  
 From above comparison, **KMPlayer** is the most stable media player for iPhone recorded slow motion videos no matter in HEVC or AVC H264\. It successfully reads iOS recorded slow-mo video with speed marks as contained in the video data. However, Gomplayer jumps frames rapidly; VLC freezes at the first frame, unable to read; Potplayer only reads slow motion video in HEVC codec and plays AVC H264 slow-mo video at normal speed. 

## Part 5: VLC Alternatives for Windows 360-deg Playback Test

#### **VLC 3.0.4 Vetinari for Windows** \- 360-deg video playback quality and CPU usage **\[#4\]**

VLC media player only supports raw 360-deg videos. It cannot enforce 360 visual to any video as other players do and can only deliver nomo mode for none raw 360-deg videos. [VLC 360 not working issue](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) happens frequently. 

![Windows VLC Alternative 360 Video Playback](https://www.5kplayer.com/vlc/img/vlc-360.jpg)

#### **KMplayer 2018.10.7.14 for Windows** \- 360-deg video playback quality and CPU usage **\[#1\]**

There are three 360 degree video modes to choose in KMPlayer: original size, normal mode VR and little planet mode VR. The only drawback of this player for 360 video playback is its relatively slow interactive response and poor video quality. 

![Windows VLC Alternative 360 Video Playback](https://www.5kplayer.com/vlc/img/km-360.jpg)

#### **PotPlayer 1.7.14804 for Windows** \- 360-deg video playback quality and CPU usage **\[#2\]**

There are even more 360-deg video modes in PotPlayer, as we can see from the given screenshot. It even supports 2 google cardboad modes, proving it a very delicately crafted video player. 

![Windows VLC Alternative 360 Video Playback](https://www.5kplayer.com/vlc/img/pot-360.jpg)

#### **GOMplayer 2.3.34.5295 for Windows** \- 360-deg video playback quality and CPU usage **\[#3\]**

![Windows VLC Alternative 360 Video Playback](https://www.5kplayer.com/vlc/img/gom-360.jpg)

**Verdict**:  
 GOMplayer delivers flexible and quick 360-deg video interactive response between mouse clicks and the view angle, it also provides a tank of 360-deg videos from online for direct playback with relatively better visuals. GOM is like a 360-deg themed video player, while Potplayer and KMplayer only offers the ability to read those files in serveral modes. VLC is the poorest player to handle 360-deg videos.

## Another VLC Player Alternative Windows - 5KPlayer

Another VLC alternative for Windows would be [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/). This media player is a more elegant version of VLC which provides AirPlay mirroring recording, DLNA streaming, YouTube download, live streaming, as well as 4K HEVC video playback utilities. You can not only use it to play common videos audio in MOV MP4 MPEG ASF DivX FLV and MP3 WAV AAC etc, but also open CDs and DVDs. Even better, this Windows VLC player alternative allows you to adjust movies and extract audio from a video.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

All in all, for 4K/8K 8-bit video(gopro/drone/YouTube downloads,etc), go for KMPlayer > PotPlayer > GOMPlayer.  
For 360-deg VR video, go for PotPlayer = GOMPlayer = KMPlayer.   
For iPhone recorded Slow-Mo video, go for KMPlayer > PotPlayer > GOMPlayer.

To make story shorter and be even more helpful:  
Install 5KPlayer, KMPlayer, PotPlayer, GOMPlayer, besides VLC. And it is prooved that VLC does not deserve its "BEST" title for Windows PC in terms of the above tested video playback.
