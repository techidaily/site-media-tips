## How to Achieve VLC Video AirPlay?

 _Written by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21)_ | Last update: June 23, 2020

Can we AirPlay VLC videos, like MKV files on a Mac book air/pro? This article will help you find out whether this media player tycoon can meet your increasing new demand – AirPlay. And the answer is half positive, as it cannot achieve AirPlay independently and may bring along a whole litany of inconveniences.

#### **"Integrate" VLC AirPlay**

 \* You can resort to the Mac OS X built-in AirPlay function to enable VLC video AirPlay. By turning on AirPlay Display in the display setting, you can [connect your Mac to Apple TV](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) and then start AirPlay. Make sure your VLC MKV files are converted into AirPlay supported formats.

 \* You can also make use of the Streaming/Transcoding Wizard plug-in to mirror your screen to Apple TV. Play the video with VLC on Mac, while the same display is shown on Apple TV. This approach allows you to play any file formats you want as long as VLC manages to support, which means that you can directly use VLC to [AirPlay MKV files](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/).

#### **"Disintegrate" VLC AirPlay**

AirVLC on the other hand provides the disintegrate method that adheres to its banner –"Watch videos in VLC on your Mac and play the audio over AirPlay. All in sync" –which means that it separates sound from video display, and only AirPlay audio content which will in the meantime solve the AirPlay delay problem.

#### **Drawbacks of These VLC AirPlay Methods:**

\* The Streaming/Transcoding Wizard plug-in of VLC is quite unstable, and the connection may undergo failure at times, which can be really annoying.  
 \* AirVLC requires the installation and run of both AirVLC and VLC to perform AirPlay and you will need another speaker for your audio AirPlay, which is quite demanding.  
 \* Mac models that support AirPlay Mirroring are limited to MacBook Air (Mid 2011 or newer), MacBook Pro (Early 2011 or newer) and Mac Pro (Late 2013 or newer), so you will need to check your Mac if it is AirPlay compatible before using the Mac built-in AirPlay function.

Then, how to avoid those potential troubles? A VLC AirPlay alternative – 5KPlayer, stands out here to volunteer its service.
