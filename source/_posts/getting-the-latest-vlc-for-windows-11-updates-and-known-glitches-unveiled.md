1\. **VLC Resume Playback not Working After Windows 10 Creators Update:** Users who upgraded to latest Windows 10 Creators Update instead of following a clean install have higher chances of running into this VLC Windows 10 resume playback not working problem.

2\. **VLC Can't Play DVD:** Despite an overhaul for DVD and CD support, VLC Windows 10 still can't remove problems like [VLC can't play DVD](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/).

4\. **VLC Crashes Windows 10 with Multi-line Subtitles:** Subtitles with multiple lines may cause VLC player Windows 10 to crash. though this time support for embedded SSA subtitles is included, a precise debug would be required to enhance VLC player stability on Windows 10 PC, Surface, and Windows Phone. 

5\. **VLC Windows 10 Can't Control Play Speed Settings:** Even if you're an old friend of VLC media player, you might go nuts when trying to control play speed settings in VLC Windows Store.
