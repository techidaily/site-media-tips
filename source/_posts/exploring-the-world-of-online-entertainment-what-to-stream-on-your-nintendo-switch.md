 YouTube has billions of videos ready to be consumed. No matter your interest, whether it's how-tos, gaming, comedy, beauty, fashion, technology, and fitness, there's a content creator for you.

 If you're a fan of movies and series, the Hulu app on Nintendo Switch is for you. The streaming service is known for its great Hulu Originals, including The Bear, Only Murders in the Building, The Handmaid's Tale, and PEN15.

 Furthermore, through partnerships with Disney (which owns it), Fox, Showtime, and other partners, there's an expansive library of great entertainment to enjoy. It has also partnered with BBC America, ABC, and ESPN+ to provide live news, sports, and entertainment.

 While the Hulu app is free to download on your Switch, you need a paid subscription to access its content. The basic plan with ads will set you back $7.99 per month. If you want to remove ads or add live TV channels, you'll have to pay more.

 If you are a new subscriber or an eligible returning customer, Hulu may offer you a one-month free trial to watch its movies and series.

##  Crunchyroll

 You can catch up on your favorite anime with the Crunchyroll app on Nintendo Switch. [Crunchyroll has a ton of anime](https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-resolve-samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-screen-not-working-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/), including modern titles like Attack on Titan, Demon Slayer, and Jujutsu Kaisen. You can also find classic anime here, such as Dragon Ball Z, One Piece, and Cowboy Bebop.

 What makes Crunchyroll great is its simulcasts. This means you can watch the latest ongoing anime as it airs in Japan—no need to wait. You can watch anime for free with some limitations (ads and premium locked episodes), on other platforms (PC, Android, and iOS). But, unfortunately, the Nintendo Switch app only works with the premium plans.

 Luckily, there's a two-week free trial period that works with the Switch app if you're a new subscriber. Afterward, you can subscribe to the premium plan, starting at $7.99 per month.

 Don't be disappointed by the limited selection of streaming apps on the Nintendo Switch. Whether you have the [original Switch, OLED, or Lite](https://win11.techidaily.com/1719355296197-dimming-windows-11-brightness-simple-fixes-unveiled/), remember it's primarily a gaming console. You shouldn't expect it to have a wide range of streaming apps like TVs and Smartphones.
