### 1\. Netflix Site Error:

1\. "The Netflix website is frozen" occurs when an extension or add-on to the browser hinders it from working properly. Countermeasures vary depending on which browser you're using:   
Firefox: Visit Menu > Help > Restart with Add-ons Disabled.  
Chrome: Enter **chrome://extensions in the address bar > uncheck any enabled boxes > save > visit Netflix**  
Safari: Safari > Preferences > Extensions tab > Toggle switch Extensions to OFF > Restart Netflix  
Internet Explorer: Tools > **Manage add-ons** \> **Show**, **All add-ons** \> Disable all add-ons to eradicate possible Netflix site errors. 

2\. If you could see nothing but a gray screen while watching Netflix on computer, click on the grey part of the screen (If an icon "Activate Silverlight" appears, click on it) > **Select Allow and Remember** before visiting Netflix again.

### 2\. Netflix Network Error:

When you see the Netflix error message: "Cannot Connect to the Internet", or error code F7031-1105, probably your Internet environment is out of fix.  
The connection side Netflix errors can be addressed without much hassle, and you may try the following measures below one after another until streaming quality returns to normal.  
Reboot your home network > Connect computer to modem > Restore ISP's default settings > Improve Wi-Fi signal.

### 3\. Netflix Display Error

**1\. Netflix blackscreen with/without player controls/with flying blue dots on computer.**  
 For the abovementioned 3 cases, please find the corresponding resolves:  
 For black screen only, you need to quit all browsers & run a new browser as administrator > open netflix with it. If you can't see the player control properly displayed, quite possible this is problem with Silverlight plug-in, and you may refer to Netflix silverlight error; If you see the blue dots anyway, first run browser as administrator, and then troubleshoot the Silverlight plug-in errors.

**2\. Red tint(s) appear on display when streaming.**  
 The red tints, black-and-white Netflix video errors occur when your graphics card driver is out-of-date, and you'll need to reinstall the driver, restart computer, and put on another piece of shows. In most cases this solves your Netflix display error.

**3\. Netflix videos go black-and-white when playing.**  
 Same as the red tint error.

 **4\. Netflix won't go full-screen error** When either your browser (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, IE or Opera) or the Silverlight plug-in goes wrong, Netflix won't go full screen properly. For plug-in errors, refer to Silverlight error, for browser errors, read general Netflix Not Working guide.>

 **5\. Videos choke/choppy during playback** Select another Netflix video clip to see if the choke still exist, or else this results from improper audio card or sound manager settings. Xonar DX Audio users should: open the audio center > select DSP mode > Deselect the GX option. HT Omega Striker 7.1 audio software users should: Open the Audio Center > Deselect EX Xear 3D.

 **6\. Subtitles playback errors in Netflix.** Any tweaked DNS settings may lead to subtitles not playing properly on your computer, hence you need to disable: first VPN or DNS settings > add-ons for browsers to solve this Netflix playback problem.

 **7\. Netflix player off-center when playing.** Third-party advertisements, when failed to play with your computer's ad-block software, may land you in this off-center problem. In this regard, these 5 programs recommended by Netflix officially can help: Ad-Aware, Sophos, Trend Micro, F-Secure, Symantec.

### 4\. Netflix Outage/Netflix Server Down:

Just like the latest case in 2017-02-08 when Amazon's Web service outage disrupted its site users, Netflix could be once in a while suffering from unexpected outages or temporary server down due to overcrowded traffic. 

Seems there's not much to do about the server side error, and users may hopefully want to visit this place https://help.netflix.com/en/is-netflix-down to report Netflix server down to see if the problem unfolds across the country or there's just something wrong with his own Internet.

### 5\. Unlocator Netflix/Netflix DNS Proxy Error & Netflix VPN Errors:

For VPN and DNS proxy users who wishes to watch series & TV shows abroad, Netflix DNS proxy error and VPN problems are like an endless nightmare no exit. Particularly about the 2, Express VPN Netflix seems to overtake proxy providers, which can't evade even some most basic blocks from Netflix.

In theory there's no permanent solution for Netflix's overseas VPN ban, which means hopping onto a new VPN provider is the only fix for Netflix proxy errors. To that end, you may check out the following 7 recommended by comparitech.com at your own risk:  
 ExpressVPN, Buffered, StrongVPN, NordVPN, VyprVPN, LiquidVPN.

### 6\. Netflix Error 1011

![](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/1011-netflix-error.jpg) 

Netflix error code 1011 points to a Netflix APP error.   
 iOS Netflix APP: Troubleshoot network connection > Restart Netflix APP > Uninstall & Reinstall APP.  
 Android, Tablet APP: Connect the device to a different network > Use diagnostics tools of your Android device to test the Internet status.  
 \* Mac & Windows Netflix: Learn more about [Netflix APP for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) and [Netflix APP for Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) on the 2 pages.

### 7\. Netflix Not Working \[General Netflix Error\]

When the streaming site just won't play your TV shows anyhow, chances are that you'll come to the error code F7053-1803, or one of the following messages,  
_Whoops, something went wrong..._  
_Unexpected Error_  
_There was an unexpected error. Please reload the page and try again._

Netflix may easily go wrong if you're visiting the website from Firefox using incognito mode, or any other mainstream browsers. Here're the approaches to the situation:  
 Firstly, turn off private browsing mode (incognito mode) > Secondly, clear the past Netflix cookies on your computer by visiting: https://www.netflix.com/, and sign in with your account & password again > Thirdly, enable cookies in the browser. 

If the above 3 steps fail to load content from Netflix, click on the mouse a few more times to Refresh your browser (here's what you can do with Firefox): Visit Menu > Help > Troubleshooting information > Refresh Firefox. 

**Tips and Notes:**  
 Refreshing the browser means losing customizable data remembered in the past.  
 Please free up at least 100MB of storage space in order not to run into Netflix not working error.

### 8\. Netflix Silverlight Plug-in Error:

By and large, the following error codes indicate that you're stuck in Netflix's plug-in errors: Netflix error 2110, 7733628, 7735335, 7735410\.   
**\[Solved\] Silverlight Error Netflix:**
