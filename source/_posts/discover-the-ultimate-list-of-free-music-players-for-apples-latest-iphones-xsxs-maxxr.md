1\. Native music app for iPhone XS/XS Max/XR lacks of swipe options, it lists all songs under each album when you tap one Artist column, instead of listing just the artists' albums and when you want to play a specific song you just need to open the album, so this missing feature of iPhone XS/XS Max/XR native music app makes it difficult or time-consuming to locate the target song. 

2\. Native Music app for iPhone XS/XS Max/XR not playing lossless music FLAC or other popular music formats other than MP3, AAC.
