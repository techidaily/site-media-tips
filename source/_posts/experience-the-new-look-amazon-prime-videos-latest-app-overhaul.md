## Experience the New Look: Amazon Prime Video's Latest App Overhaul

Amazon is now pushing a redesigned Prime Video app that prioritizes "clarity and simplicity." The redesigned app should roll out to all users by the end of the week.

 Since its inception, Prime Video has billed itself as a be-all streaming platform that fulfills multiple (somewhat confusing) roles. You can pay for a Prime Video subscription and unlock a bunch of shows and movies, though some content is only available for rental or purchase. Plus, Prime Video is filled with add-on "[channels](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/store/channels?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004341&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fprime-video-redesign-2024%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term)" like Paramount+ or Maxâ€”some people have multiple streaming subscriptions but _only_ use the Prime Video app.

 Today's Prime Video redesign aims to make this functionality more obvious and manageable. Amazon has ditched its left-handed sidebar, which was [first rolled out in 2022](https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/in-2024-4-feasible-ways-to-fake-location-on-facebook-for-your-itel-p40-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), in favor of an easy-to-read horizontal navbar.

 The left side of this navbar is dedicated to content discovery. If you open the "Movies" tab, for example, you'll be met with suggestions based on your watch history. These suggestions will span the gamut of Prime Video, meaning that some will require an additional purchase on top of your normal subscription.

 Conversely, the right side of the new navbar is dedicated to services that you already pay for. Press the "Prime" tab, and you'll _only_ see the content that is included for free with your subscription (you couldn't filter things this way in the old app). If you pay for add-on "channels" like Max or Paramount+, they will also appear as tabs on the right side of the navbar.

 The updated app also improves your ability to manage subscriptions within Prime Video. If you need to cancel a subscription, for example, you should be able to do so from the new in-app "subscriptions" destination. The subscriptions page will also serve as a platform for adding new "channels" and hunting for deals. There are some inevitable AI integrations, too. Amazon says that it's using an LLM to generate movie and show descriptions, and content recommendations based on your watch history will be complied by a machine learning process.

 Amazon's redesigned Prime Video app is now rolling out to streaming devices ("including older models"). It may take a week for the update to reach all customers.
