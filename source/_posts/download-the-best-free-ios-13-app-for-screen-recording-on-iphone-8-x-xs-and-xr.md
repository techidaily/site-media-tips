## Free iPhone 8/X/XS/XR/11 Screen Recorder iOS 13 Download

 _Written by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21)_ | Last update: April 28, 2020

**\- Top best iPhone 8/X/XS/XR/11 screen recorder for iOS 13 download free** on Windows Mac.

Those who want to **record iPhone 8/X/XS/XR/11 iOS 13 screens** will definately love the 2 big shining features of new iPhone 8/X/XS/XR/11 iOS 13:   
 a. the large 5.8 inch OLED display with 520 PPI in a bezel-less glass design which has 2K resolution and a display ratio that could exceed 2:1;  
 b. iOS 12 system-level screen recording in Control Center.   
 These two augments will absolutely stimulate our screen recording efficiency and quality with more pixels. 

On top of that, iPhone 8/X/XS/XR/11 front-facing camera and infrared sensor module might be able to scan the 3D environment, meaning we can take 3D selfies or even record 3D videos. The possibilities are surely endless when it comes to inserting 3D scans of physical objects into the virtual world and of course, there would be AR. And if go-wireless trend pushes wireless charging into form, many existing controversies can be resolved. These tech improvements would all be appreciated for iOS 13 screen recording anyhow.

**There used to be mainly three ways to record iPhone 8/X/XS/XR/11 screen**, i.e.   
1\. Download iPhone 8/X/XS/XR/11 screen recorder apps like Vidyo, iRec, BB Rec, AirShou, Display Recorder etc to record iOS screen without jailbreak;  
2\. Download free screen recording software on Window Mac to record iOS screen without jailbreak;   
3\. Jailbreak iOS devices and make use of Cydia.

However, since Apple does not welcome iPhone screen recorder apps like Vidyo, Airshou to their app store, for specialized screen recorder apps, you will have to find them elsewhere – installing their IPA files from outside of Apple app store. And since the jail-broken iPhone is not absolutely safe and stable, unless it is the only way, no one would choose that as the first option. The best choice here might be boiled down to computer screen recorders.

**Built-in iOS 13 Screen Recording Feature Seems Willing to Take the Whole Cake Alone**  
Now iOS 13 rolls out system screen recording feature, tempting to rule out other third-party players from the game. On the one hand, we can enjoy more straightforward and simple recording controls, while on the other hand, we might be suffering from the mounting videos that might eat up our iOS storage and seek for [iOS video transfer software](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/iphone-manager/). What if there is a way to directly and wirelessly record iPhone 8/X/XS/XR/11 screen from computers?

**Common iPhone screen recording problems**  
"Hey guys, I'm starting a Gaming channel soon on iOS gaming but I can't find the right app to record my iPhone screen. Some require me to Jailbreak my device but I don't want to. Is there any other ways? Like using Mac/Windows perhaps?"   
Since the quantity of the videos will be enormous as for building gaming channel, no matter how large your iPhone story is, one can always easily find shortage of iPhone storage. So the best place for screen recordings is your computer. Thus here, we recommend you 5KPlayer!
