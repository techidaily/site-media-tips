As you may have the doubts as of whether iTunes for Windows is a PC AirPlay receiver itself, the answer may just disappoint you. Indeed with iTunes comes Bonjour, the very streaming protocol required for a receiver, yet iTunes was not designed to turn your computer into an Apple-TV-like device, hence the need for a 3rd-party AirPlay receiver for PC to handle the job.

### NO. 1 Free PC AirPlay Receiver HD - Utmost Usable 5KPlayer

To get satiny and smooth AirPlay performance from iPhone iOS to PC, you need [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/). There are 3 reasons for its touching-top in the list:

For one thing, this PC AirPlay receiver freeware can take Apple's localized AirPlay to PC with any version of Windows OS: Windows 10/8/7/Vista. Now that the complete set of AirPlay include video/music streaming (playback windows only), or use PC as an Apple TV 5 to connect iPhone 11\.

![5KPlayer - best free PC AirPlay receiver](https://www.5kplayer.com/airplay/img/airplay-iphone-to-windows-10.jpg) 

Among all the peer software out there, 5KPlayer is the only PC AirPlay Receiver gaining 7.4/10 user ratings, and 8.0/10 download site ratings, thanks to its top-of-the-line streaming quality, and the much-intuitive GUI that requires least efforts for you to handle.

Apple's native [AirPlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) is a breakthrough in wireless streaming protocols, connecting iPhone 11 iOS 13, iPad, Mac and Apple TV relying on nothing but your home Wi-Fi, and 5KPlayer is the very AirPlay receiver PC to welcome Windows users into this ecosystem in an all-round manner. Check out this list of specs of the free PC AirPlay receiver:

| System Compatibility                                                                              | Image Quality                                                              | Video and Audio Format | Recording Function |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| iPhone 4S or newer; iPad 2 or newer; iPad mini or newer; iPod Touch 5 or newer. Windows 10/8.1/7. | Retina Quality AirPlay(support iPhone 1920\*1920 > Apple TV AirPlay 1080p) | MP4/M4V/MOV;MP3/AAC    | Configurable       |

### NO. 2 Multi-Device Compatible AirPlay Receiver PC - Airserver

This PC AirPlay receiver is now in its version 6.0 updated on July, 2019\. A compact file size at 12MB only defines itself as "quite compact" as befitting an AirPlay receiver. 

A fairly tedious preparation is required if you're to use AirServer. First, a PC running Windows 7 has to install an update for Universal C RunTime in Windows (KB2999226), which can be obtained from the following link: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2999226\. 

Remember to check out whether your computer is a 64bit or 32bit one before downloading the corresponding update pack.

While running the installing wizard of this AirPlay receiver Windows 10, the Miracast streaming protocol is optional, which enables your PC to receiver streaming videos from Windows 8/10 devices/Android. However, to set up [Miracast AirPlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/), you PC itself has to run Windows 8.1/10.

 After all, successfully sitting through the somewhat tinkerer means you can now fully indulge yourself in the Retina quality mirroring of the AirPlay receiver PC. You could be interested in its mirroring-based recording function as well, which enables you to create tutorials, reviews, walkthroughs shown on a PC, in exactly the same way 5KPlayer can do.

AirServer is the only rechargeable receiver in today's list, coming at $14.99/license/PC.

### NO. 3 LonelyScreen AirPlay Receiver Windows

![LonelyScreen AirPlay receiver PC](https://www.5kplayer.com/airplay/img/lonely-screen-pc-airplay-receiver.jpg) 

Big name PC AirPlay receivers tend to impress users with relatively stable performance, but flexible widgets like LonelyScreen AirPlay can set up iPhone 11 AirPlay to PC just as faithfully and adorably. 

However, the set-up process of LonelyScreen PC AirPlay receiver seems even more lengthy than that of AirServer. At first you may find the setup file of LonelyScreen AirPlay receiver Windows extremely compact: 600 KB in its latest version 1.2.12, yet it takes my Windows 7 PC (64 bit) roughly 30 minutes for the rest of the components to finish downloading alone. The good thing is, you may connect iPhone to this AirPlay receiver Windows as soon as it finishes installing.   
 There's no 64bit/32bit version of this AirPlay receiver Windows, because it fits them both, but a Mac version is available.

**Note:** Running this AirPlay receiver PC freeware, your computer will most probably require you to check the firewall settings and make sure that you allow LonelyScreen to communicate through Windows PC's firewall by going to "Start > Control Panel > Security > Windows Firewall"  
Under the Firewall panel, find "Allow a program through Windows Firewall" on the right-sidebar, then make sure the box is checked next to LonelyScreen AirPlay receiver PC, click OK to confirm.

**Where to Download LonelyScreen AirPlay Receiver PC free?**  
 Download AirPlay receiver from Softonic: https://lonelyscreen-airplay-receiver.en.softonic.com/download  
 Download from LonelyScreen Homepage: http://www.lonelyscreen.com/download.html

**Tips:** When searching for secured download links of this PC AirPlay receiver free, we found its Softonic user rating is only 1 out of 10 which, when compared to the 7.4 out of 10 of 5KPlayer as befitting free software applications, may attribute to its lengthy installation or some other bugs we've not discovered yet.
