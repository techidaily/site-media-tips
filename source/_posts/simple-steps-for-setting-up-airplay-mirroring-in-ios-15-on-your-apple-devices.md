However, it is a very buggy version that iOS 15 has to be released to make up for that as soon as possible, but you are still suggested to draw feedbacks to Apple during iOS 15 AirPlay or other operations to help make the new operating system much stronger.

**What Can We Expect from iOS 13/14/15 AirPlay Mirroring?**

Worth mentioning, the Photos app has been largely improved for image editing and you can cast the edited photos to Mac/PC or Apple TV through iOS 13 mirroring to enjoy with friends or families. If interested, you can also show off Maps on bigger screen with iOS 13 AirPlay as the new Maps app will allow you to see streets or find places just in a real way. As for iOS 14, it is the biggest update ever since iOS 7 that there are surely various new features for you to explore. Now, iOS 15 beta version is available to download free.

 Not all iOS devices are compatible with the new iOS 15 update, according to news. iOS 15 mirroring will be available for iPhone (12, 12 mini, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max, 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, XS, XS Max, XR, X, 8, 8 Plus, 7, 7 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, SE 1st generation, SE 2nd generation and iPod touch 7th generation, while iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus will be stuck on iOS 12\. So, check if your device has satisfied the basic requirement before start AirPlay mirroring iOS 15, otherwise [iOS 15 screen mirroring not working](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) happens.

**iPads Also Allow for iOS 15 AirPlay Mirroring**  
 Apple had introduced a brand new operating system for its iPad models called iPadOS, but we really don't know if the iPadOS is the specific iOS 13/14/15 for iPads. Once you update your iPad, you will download iPadOS on your iPads. So, if you have the 12.9-, 11-, 10.5- and 9.7-inch iPad Pro, iPad (sixth generation), iPad (fifth generation), iPad mini (fifth generation), iPad mini 4, iPad Air (third generation), iPad Air 2, you may think you do not have the chance to enjoy iOS 13/14/15 screen mirroring on these iPad models.

However, with a third-party tool like AirPlay server 5KPlayer, we can have the chance to display iOS 15 devices' content to computer wirelessly.  
 5KPlayer is born to be a versatile iOS AirPlay mirroring tool that helps connect vast number of iOS 15 devices and Mac/Windows computer in a wireless way.
