Once you pay for the package from TBA (licensed by NBA), this all-round sports streaming service helps you watch 40 NBA games/week (both in-market and out-of-market) on Apple TV 4/3/2\. As for the price, one-time payment comes at $99.99, or you may also go by 3 installments based on the monthly budget.

**Step 1:** Visit the Apple TV (4/3/2) App Store, click "Search" on top of the screen.  
**Step 2:** Search for "NBA", find the corresponding APP and click "Download", enter your Apple ID & code thereafter.

**Tips:** Kindly be noted that you need to use download the Apple TV NBA App with **the same account you used to purchase League Pass**, if not, then you'd better register another iTunes account to associate the TV APP and cable service to watch NBA on Apple TV 720p 1080p.

**Tips: Apple TV NBA League Pass Blackouts:**  
 Just like NFL and MLB, the block-out policy for Apple TV NBA League Pass (US League Pass) disapprove the live streaming of NBA playoffs by this service when a specific is being televised by local TV channels, which means you won't be able to watch NBA playoffs or finals on Apple TV unless you somehow re-locate the IP address to a non-blackout region, which sounds troublesome enough. 

Apple TV NBA League Pass offers multi-platform availability to watch all playoffs, which makes it one of the most reliable method if you want to watch Apple TV NBA.

 So far, the 2 of the top 3 sports streaming service providers, ESPN (Entertainment and Sports Programming Networks) and ABC (American Broadcasting Company) has arrived at Apple TV application store, named WatchESPN and "ABC – Watch Live TV & Stream Full Episodes" respectively, but not TNT. This helps ESPN and ABC subscribers directly start streaming NBA playoffs on Apple TV as an add-up service of their everyday subscription. Speaking of the price, the $7.04/month for ESPN seems more advisable, plus another advantage that makes it a wise choice: some of the games blacked-out on Apple TV NBA Pass League turn out available on ESPN.
