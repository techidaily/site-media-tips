Quite a few cable-TV users tend to use the Apple TV NBA League Pass service to watch 2023 NBA playoffs full season games. Once you pay for the package from TBA (licensed by NBA), this all-round sports streaming service helps you watch 40 NBA games/week (both in-market and out-of-market) on Apple TV 4/3/2\. As for the price, one-time payment comes at $99.99, or you may also go by 3 installments based on the monthly budget.

 **How to Download Apple TV NBA League Pass & Watch NBA Playoffs 2023?**  
**Step 1:** Visit the Apple TV (4/3/2) App Store, click "Search" on top of the screen.  
**Step 2:** Search for "NBA", find the corresponding APP and click "Download", enter your Apple ID & code thereafter.

**Tips:** Kindly be noted that you need to use download the Apple TV NBA App with **the same account you used to purchase League Pass**, if not, then you'd better register another iTunes account to associate the TV APP and cable service to watch NBA on Apple TV 720p 1080p.

**Tips: Apple TV NBA League Pass Blackouts:**  
 Just like NFL and MLB, the block-out policy for Apple TV NBA League Pass (US League Pass) disapprove the live streaming of NBA playoffs by this service when a specific is being televised by local TV channels, which means you won't be able to watch NBA playoffs or finals on Apple TV unless you somehow re-locate the IP address to a non-blackout region, which sounds troublesome enough. 

Apple TV NBA League Pass offers multi-platform availability to watch all playoffs, which makes it one of the most reliable method if you want to watch Apple TV NBA. Yet chances are that you already have a cable TV service which broadcasts NBA playoffs 2023, and and simply downloading their tvOS counterparts can immediately help you watch NBA on Apple TV without any extra spending.

 So far, the 2 of the top 3 sports streaming service providers, ESPN (Entertainment and Sports Programming Networks) and ABC (American Broadcasting Company) has arrived at Apple TV application store, named WatchESPN and "ABC â€“ Watch Live TV & Stream Full Episodes" respectively, but not TNT. This helps ESPN and ABC subscribers directly start streaming NBA playoffs on Apple TV as an add-up service of their everyday subscription. Speaking of the price, the $7.04/month for ESPN seems more advisable, plus another advantage that makes it a wise choice: some of the games blacked-out on Apple TV NBA Pass League turn out available on ESPN.
