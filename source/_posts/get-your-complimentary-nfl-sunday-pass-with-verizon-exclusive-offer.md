## Get Your Complimentary NFL Sunday Pass with Verizon - Exclusive Offer!

New and existing Verizon customers can secure the 2024 NFL Sunday Ticket for free after joining a qualifying phone or internet plan. Those who are already subscribed to Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate may also redeem this offer by purchasing a new smartphone, and Verizon customers who don't want to upgrade can enjoy a $100 discount on the Sunday Ticket, no strings attached.

 The Sunday Ticket is now distributed by [YouTube and YouTube TV](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-check-if-your-nokia-g22-is-unlocked-by-drfone-android/) instead of DirecTV. It costs $449 (although it's $350 for YouTube TV subscribers), which is prohibitively expensive for most football fans. A new phone or internet plan is a sizable investment, but [Verizon's promotional offer](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004363/https://www.verizon.com/nfl-sunday-ticket-on-youtube-streaming/) may provide significant savings for customers who are already interested in making a change.

 You _do not_ need a YouTube Premium membership to redeem this offer, as the NFL Sunday Ticket can be streamed from [YouTube Primetime Channels](https://www.androidpolice.com/what-are-youtube-primetime-channels/). That said, Verizon is also offering [$10 off YouTube TV](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004363/https://www.verizon.com/solutions-and-services/apps/youtube-tv/).

* **New Mobile Plan Purchase**: Customers who set up a cellular [Unlimited plan](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004363/https://www.verizon.com/plans/unlimited/) and purchase a qualifying smartphone get a season of the NFL Sunday Ticket for free.
* **New Home Internet Plan**: New and existing customers who sign up for a qualifying [Verizon Home Internet](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004363/https://www.verizon.com/home/internet/) plan get a season of the NFL Sunday Ticket for free.
* **Device Upgrade**: Existing customers who purchase a qualifying device on an Unlimited Plus plan will secure a free season of NFL Sunday Ticket.
* **For Customers Who Don't Want to Upgrade**: Existing Verizon customers who don't upgrade can still [save $100](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004363/https://www.verizon.com/support/nfl-st-on-us-promo-legal/) on the Sunday Ticket.

 This is more or less identical to the NFL Sunday Ticket promo that Verizon ran [last year](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/slicephoto-inspection/). Verizon has a relatively strong relationship with the NFL, so there's a decent chance that we'll see a repeat of this deal in 2025\. So, crafty NFL fans might switch to Verizon for this year's promo and set up Verizon Home Internet during next year's promo.

 As for whether this promotion is worth the cost of entryâ€”it depends. The most affordable path toward this deal is probably the Verizon Home Internet subscription, as qualifying plans start at just $35 a month. And if you're already a Verizon Unlimited cellular subscriber, upgrading your smartphone may only cost you a few hundred dollars with a trade-in.

 But if you're currently subscribed to a super-cheap phone plan, switching to Verizon Unlimited Plus just to save $449 on the NFL Sunday Ticket is probably a bad idea. Verizon Unlimited Plus is about $55 per line per month. That adds up to a total of $660 per line each year.

 Note that Verizon cellular and home internet plans include several streaming perks, including [$10 subscriptions](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-bandicam-vs-camtasia-which-is-better/) to services like Netflix, Max, Disney+, and Hulu. Customers who secure a free NFL Sunday Ticket can still redeem these streaming perks.

 You can check out some of the extra details, including qualifying plans and devices, at the [Verizon NFL Sunday Ticket](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2004363/https://www.verizon.com/nfl-sunday-ticket-on-youtube-streaming/) landing page.
