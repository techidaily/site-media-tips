## Part 3\. How to Turn MP4 Videos into WAV Audio Using Audacity

[Audacity](https://tools.techidaily.com/) is an open-source audio editor that doubles as a handy tool for extracting audio from video files. While not its primary function, Audacity's customizable options make it a solid choice for converting MP4 files to WAV audio. This free MP4 to WAV converter is available for Windows, Mac, Linux, and other platforms.

 Audacity requires the FFmpeg library to open and import certain video and audio formats, including MP4, AAC, WMA, and more. That is due to licensing restrictions, as Audacity cannot distribute these codecs themselves. So, you should visit the Installing FFmpeg page and install the correct version compatible with your operating system.

![Audacity Installing FFmpeg](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/resource/mp4-to-wav/audacity-installing-ffmpeg.jpg)

Step 1.

 If you haven't Audacity already, download and install it on your computer first. Launch Audacity, then click File > Import > Audio to open your MP4 video. Audacity imports the audio track from your MP4 file. You will see the waveform representation of the audio in the main interface.

![Audacity Import MP4](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/resource/mp4-to-wav/audacity-import-mp4.jpg)

Step 2.

 Click the File menu and hit the Export Audio option. In the Export Audio dialogue box, under Format, select WAV. You can adjust the channels, encoding, and sample rate for the WAV file using the provided options.

Step 3.

 Rename the converted WAV audio and click Browse to choose a destination folder for your WAV file. Click Export to begin the audio conversion process. Once exported, you can further edit your WAV file within Audacity's interface. Trim segments, apply effects, or utilize its noise reduction features for enhanced audio quality.

![Audacity Convert MP4 to WAV](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/resource/mp4-to-wav/audacity-convert-mp4-to-wav.jpg)

 If you fail to import videos to Audacity, check and ensure you download the correct FFmpeg version for your operating system architecture. Also, make sure Audacity is pointing to the correct location of the ffmpeg.exe (Windows) or libavformat library (Mac/Linux). After the FFmpeg installation, restart Audacity.

## Part 4\. How to Transform MP4 to WAV with FFmpeg

 FFmpeg is a powerful command-line tool used for processing multimedia files. It can encode, decode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter, and play pretty much anything in terms of audio and video formats. It can convert MP4s to high-quality WAV files.

![Download FFmpeg from Official](https://www.aiseesoft.com/images/resource/mp4-to-wav/download-ffmpeg-from-official.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Step 2.

 As a Windows user, launch Command Prompt from the Start menu. For Mac and Linux users, open Terminal through Spotlight or the Applications folder. Use the cd command to move to the directory containing your MP4 video. For instance, if your MP4 is in the Downloads folder, type Downloads.

ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.wav

 Replace input.mp4 with the actual filename of your MP4 video. Replace output.wav with your desired filename for the converted WAV file.

Step 3.

 FFmpeg offers various options to fine-tune your WAV output.

Adjust Bitrate: ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:a 1600k output.wav

Choose Sample Rate: ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ar 44100 output.wav

Step 4.

 Hit Enter after typing your customized command. FFmpeg will extract the pristine audio from your MP4 and weaving it into a WAV file. Your newly minted WAV file will be saved in the same directory as your MP4 video.
