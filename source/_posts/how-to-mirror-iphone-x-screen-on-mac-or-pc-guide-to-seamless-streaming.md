## Stream Videos Music from iPhone X to Mac OS/PC

 _Written by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21)_ | Last update: April 28, 2020

Have some videos or audio stored on your iPhone X/8 and want to put them to the larger screen like a computer? Well if so you may have started to look for a proper cable to transfer contents from iPhone X/8 to Mac or PC. Why bother? You can simply stream movies, TV shows, music and songs on iPhone 8 to computer. No wires, no cluttering, no wait. You only need a shared wi-fi network. But how? Follow the tips on **streaming for iPhone X/8** below. 

Things are getting simpler when you have stored a stack of videos or music on your iPhone X/8 and want to share with your friends. Yes, with just an iPhone X/8 in hand, you can stream iPhone contents to a television through Apple's built-in technology. However, it's weird that no options are offered to **stream video from iPhone X/8 to Mac**, Apple's own big-screen lines, let alone the windows PC. So what if you want to put the feed originates from your iPhone for viewing on Mac or PC? For example, show off a DIY iPhone X/8/7/7 Plus/SE/6s/6s Plus live stream recorded with the iPhone's camera when no Apple TV is available? Instead of having your iPhone connected to computer through wires, it's lucky that a third-party streaming software [**5KPlayer**](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) makes wireless **streaming for iPhone X/8 to both Mac and PC** possible.

Serving as a free and professional media player, 5KPlayer embraces the powerful ability to stream iPhone X/8/7/7 Plus/SE/5C/6s/6s Plus to computers. By turning Mac/PC into an [audio video receiver](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/), any media contents, such as movies, videos, music, songs, recorded clips etc can be streamed from not only iPhone (including iPhone X/8/7/7 Plus, SE/5C, iPhone 6/6 Plus, iPhone 6s/6s Plus, etc), but also other iOS devices like iPod [iPad to Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) and PC. In addition to **stream movies on iPhone 8, stream tv shows on iPhone X** or other contents on iPhone X/8, 5KPlayer can also transform your computer into an media content sender, which means you can stream [film video from computer to Apple TV](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/). To stream from iPhone with 5KPlayer is just as simple as streaming to a television with an Apple TV.

This [streaming software](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) also allows users to stream video music from iPhone X/8/7/7 Plus/SE/6s/6s Plus and iPad Pro to Mac/PC as detailed above, but also stream various videos on computer like MKV, AVI, FLV etc. to Apple TV. You should also note that 5KPlayer is far more than a media streaming software as it also integrates the features of a [video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) and online downloader. Obviously, it's worth a try for a sound reason.
