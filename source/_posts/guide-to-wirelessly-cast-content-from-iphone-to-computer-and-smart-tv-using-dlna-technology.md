 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

Want to connect iPhone to PC or TV to stream video music? Instead of using AirPlay that only works between iPhone and Apple TV by default, DLNA is a much more considerate way to stream iPhone to PC and Android smart TV for cross-platform media sharing. Therefore, this overall guide will teach you how to **DLNA iPhone** to stream video music from iPhone to computer as well as Samsung, Sony, LG, etc smart TV easily and wirelessly.

**HDMI-connect, AirPlay or DLNA iPhone to PC/TV, Which One is Better?**

Surely, the way to stream iPhone to PC or TV is never restricted to DLNA streaming. The most straightforward way to connect iPhone to TV is to use Apple's Lightning Digital AV adapter and a HDMI cable to connect iPhone to a HDTV. Plug the HDMI cable into the TV on one end and the other side in your iPhone's Lightning cable, and make sure the Lightning cable is plugged into your iPhone simultaneously. Obviously, this is not a wireless way to connect iPhone to TV and not very suitable for a PC. Worse still, you have to pay about $45 for a Lightning cable and $40 for a HDMI cable to stream media from iPhone to TV.

AirPlay is a wireless way to stream video music, but the fact is that this streaming protocol only works between iOS and Apple TV or AirPlay enabled devices. Computers can be AirPlay-enabled easily with the help of third-party AirPlay server software, while seldom smart TVs have the ability to own the inbuilt AirPlay function. So, if your target is an Android TV, you'd better give up iPhone AirPlay and turn to iPhone DLNA streaming.

**Conclusion:** Based on the fact, DLNA iPhone is surely the best way to wirelessly stream iPhone to PC, Android smart TV and billions of DLNA-certified devices with no restrictions.
