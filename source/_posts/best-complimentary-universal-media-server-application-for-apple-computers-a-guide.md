**1\. Plex DLNA Server for Mac**

Plex's free version is already capable of serving as a great DLNA server for Mac. Easy setup. Dedicated podcasts and news section. This is a good choice to maintain a personal media server on Mac. Plex cloud is dead, and one more annoying thing is its aggressive data collection.

**2\. Serviio DLNA Server for Mac**

Serviio is a free media server for Mac and windows to stream video audio and images to DLNA certified devices. Serviio streams content across various devices on your home network, but figuring out how to get this media server software working takes a lot of effort and patience. Confusing setup. Failed to work on some theoretically compatible devices in testing, and the most intuitive features cost money.

**3\. Universal Media Server for Mac DLNA Streaming**

Universal Media Server is an open source free DLNA-compliant UPnP media server.
