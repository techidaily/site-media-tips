Have you ransacked the Apple Support center, but didn’t find any official suggestions about **iPhone to Mac AirPlay**? In fact, you can’t natively turn Mac into an AirPlay receiver like an Apple TV to display contents or screen from iPhone or iPad. Despite the fact, things won’t get so bad as there is always a way to solve an issue. With third-party AirPlay-compatible software, it is very easy to AirPlay iPhone to Mac (Mac mini, iMac, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air) wirelessly.

Specifically, you can cast learning stuff from iPhone to Mac connected with a projector, so that the classroom is in your hands. You can control the class just using your portable device of choice but without the need to wandering in the room all the time. Or you can stream audio, play movies/music on big screen, and photos with friends and family. Similar to 5KPlayer, it can also help live stream YouTube, cast games and [record iPhone screens](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/).
