You can control the class just using your portable device of choice but without the need to wandering in the room all the time. Or you can stream audio, play movies/music on big screen, and photos with friends and family. Similar to 5KPlayer, it can also help live stream YouTube, cast games and [record iPhone screens](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/).
