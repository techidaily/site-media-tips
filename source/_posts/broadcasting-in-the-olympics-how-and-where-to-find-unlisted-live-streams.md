## Broadcasting in the Olympics: How and Where to Find Unlisted Live Streams

### Key Takeaways

* Peacock is the only destination for full Paris Olympics coverage.
* A Peacock Premium or Premium Plus subscription provides live access to all events, plus highlights, commentaries, and other bonuses.
* Check NBC's Paris Olympics schedule, as you may find that the free OTA broadcast contains everything you need.

 While a great portion of the 2024 Summer Olympics will be broadcast for free on NBC, sports fanatics may be disappointed by NBC's live coverage. Thankfully, Peacock will provide full live coverage and additional content for all Paris Olympic events.

 The Paris Olympics will kick off with an Opening Ceremony on July 26th, although ranking and placement rounds for some sports will begin a few days beforehand. Final games and the Closing Ceremony are scheduled for August 11th.

##  Streaming Is Required for Full Summer Olympics Coverage

 NBC has held the exclusive U.S. broadcasting rights to the Summer Olympic Games since 1988\. So, streaming customers can tune into the 2024 Summer Olympics through any service that offers NBCUniversal-owned television channelsâ€”YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV, and so on.

 Here's the problem: the only streaming service with full Paris Olympics coverage is the NBCUniversal-owned Peacock. If you want to view "the entire Paris Olympics, from Opening Ceremony to Closing Ceremony and everything in between," you need to sign up for [Peacock Premium](https://imp.i305175.net/c/156932/2100873/11640?subId1=htgolympicseditorial) or [Peacock Premium Plus](https://imp.i305175.net/c/156932/2100873/11640?subId1=htgolympicseditorial).

 Your Peacock subscription will provide live coverage of each Summer Olympic game, plus a selection of always-on Olympics channels, replays, highlights, documentaries, analysis, and commentary. It's a more robust experience than you'll get anywhere else, and it gives you the freedom to pick and choose what you watch. Peacock is available as a mobile app, though you can also access it through your PC, smart TV, streaming stick, or game console.

 I should point out that Peacock Premium will leap from $5 a month to [$8 a month](https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-precision-in-performance-utilizing-social-blade-for-youtube-data/) on July 18th. Some websites, including the official [NBC Olympics page](https://www.nbcolympics.com/faq), are incorrectly listing the old price.

 Be sure to check the perks that are included with your internet, phone, or cable plan, as you may find that a free Peacock Premium subscription is available to you. Cable and satellite customers can also log into the NBC or NBC Olympics apps for extensive Paris Olympics coverage.

##  OTA TV, Cable, and Satellite Coverage Is Somewhat Limited

 All NBC sports channels will provide coverage for the 2024 Summer Olympics. This includes the NBC broadcast channel, which you can view for free with nothing more than [a TV antenna](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-armies-united-exploring-the-ultimate-7-strategy-wars/).

 However, due to the nature of live television, Summer Olympics coverage through broadcast, cable, and satellite is somewhat limited. Events that are popular among U.S. viewers may receive extensive live coverage, while less popular events may be relegated to highlight reels or other segments during primetime hours.

 Cable and satellite viewers have the luxury of a large channel selection. If you don't care for whatever sport is on NBC, you can switch over to E!, the Golf Channel, CNBC, or USA Network. And, as I mentioned earlier, cable or satellite subscribers can log into the NBC or NBC Olympics apps for a Peacock-like experience.

 But if you've only got a TV antenna, you're limited to NBC. I suggest that OTA viewers keep an eye on [NBC's schedule](https://www.nbcolympics.com/full-schedule), which will eventually provide showtimes for Summer Olympic events. You can sign up for Peacock if NBC's coverage fails to suit your needs.
