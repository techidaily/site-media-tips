## Disney Series Set to Arrive on Netflix in the Coming Year

Disney and Netflix are getting cozier with each other. Disney has already solidified itself in the streaming space, and Netflix wants even more content for its users to check out, so what better thing to do than an exchange program? As _Grey's Anatomy_ makes its way to Hulu, some Disney-owned properties will also be making landfall on Netflix.

 The complete _Grey's Anatomy_ series will come to Hulu in early 2024\. Viewers will be able to tune into all existing 19 seasons, and episodes from season 20 will land on Hulu after they air on NBC. This deal frees _Grey's Anatomy_ from the clutches of Netflix and makes Hulu one of the best places to get your weekly dose of hospital drama.

 Netflix will continue streaming _Grey's Anatomy_. But, as part of this exchange deal, Disney is also giving Netflix some of its shows. These include:

* The Wonder Years (Jan 1, 2024)
* This is Us (Jan 8, 2024)
* My Wife & Kids (Feb 5, 2024)
* ESPN 30 for 30 (starting on February 2024)
* The Resident (March 4, 2024)
* White Collar (April 1, 2024)
* Reba (May 6, 2024)
* Archer (May 13, 2024)
* How I Met You Mother (June 3, 2024)
* Lost (July 1, 2024)
* Prison Break (July 29, 2024)
* The Hughleys (Sept 2, 2024)
* Bernie Mac (Jan 1, 2025)
* Home Improvement (Feb 1, 2025).

 Some of the shows listed here were previously on Netflix, so they're technically making a comeback now, while others are available on Netflix in other countries (_Archer_, for one, is on Netflix in the United Kingdom). They're also, for the most part, shows that aren't running anymore. Even the biggest shows on this list—_Lost_ and _How I Met Your Mother_—made their conclusion a decade ago. Maybe we'll see even more shared content in the coming years if this deal deepens.

 Disney is close to fully completing its streaming vision. The company has the green light to finally begin [merging Disney+ and Hulu](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-captivating-carousel-concept-for-ig-for-2024/), with Hulu's official launch on Disney+ due to happen March 2024\. This also means that when that merged experience fully rolls out, _Grey's Anatomy_ will be available to watch on Disney+. 'Tis the season for sharing, indeed.
