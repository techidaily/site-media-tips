## Common 4K Video AirPlay Errors and Solutions

You can AirPlay 4K videos, music, and photos wirelessly from your Mac/PC to HDTV. But it's often the case that AirPlay or AirPlay mirroring isn't working. According to the collection of user feedback on support.apple.com, the 4K video airplay error generally embodies in two cases: 1\. AirPlay icon missing; 2\. no device options in AirPlay menu.

Apple-suggested solutions to **4K video AirPlay error 1**: If you don't see the AirPlay icon, make sure your Apple TV is turned on and updated to the latest Apple TV software (Settings > General >Update Software). Or restart your Wi-Fi router and Apple TV.
