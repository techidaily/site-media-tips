However, it's often the case that the 4k video AirPlay error cruelly discomfits their ideal plan.

## Common 4K Video AirPlay Errors and Solutions

You can AirPlay 4K videos, music, and photos wirelessly from your Mac/PC to HDTV. But it's often the case that AirPlay or AirPlay mirroring isn't working. According to the collection of user feedback on support.apple.com, the 4K video airplay error generally embodies in two cases: 1\. AirPlay icon missing; 2\. no device options in AirPlay menu.

Apple-suggested solutions to **4K video AirPlay error 1**: If you don't see the AirPlay icon, make sure your Apple TV is turned on and updated to the latest Apple TV software (Settings > General >Update Software). Or restart your Wi-Fi router and Apple TV.

Apple-suggested solutions to **4K video AirPlay error 2**: If you don't see your Apple TV in AirPlay menu, make sure your Mac and Apple TV meet the system requirements (Mac computers with OS X Mountain Lion v10.8 or later and Apple TV \[2nd generation or later\]), and your Apple TV software is up to date. Also check your firewall sittings: 

* Click Apple menu > System Preference > Security & Privacy > Firewall.
* Enter an administrator name and password after click the lock icon.
* Click firewall options.
