## Catch All Four Sports Festivals in One Place Using Peacock – Your Ultimate Multi-Event Viewing Platform!

The Summer Olympics are back. It's arguably the biggest sports event in the world, and there's lots of stuff to check out. If there's something that we can complain about, actually, is that there might actually be _too_ much to watch. If you're interested in more than one sport or discipline, it can get hard to keep track of everything. Thankfully, the Peacock streaming service is working on multistream features to address that.

[Peacock](https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-essence-of-burst-in-gopro-filming-techniques/) has just launched a range of new features ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics. The most notable feature here is multiview, allows subscribers to watch up to four simultaneous matches. This innovation addresses the inconvenience of switching streams by putting everything you might want to check out on your screen at the same time. If you want to watch archery, fencing, taekwondo, and soccer at the same time, you can do so by using this feature. Whether you can focus on all four at the same time is a different thing, but the option is there if you want to check it out.

 In addition to multiview, Peacock introduces "Live Actions" for seamless transition between live coverage and whip-around content, alongside features like "Search by Star Athlete" and expanded highlight reels. These enhancements are set to extend beyond the Olympics, enhancing Peacock's appeal for live sports coverage. This feature, accessible with an interactive button, lets you select preferred events and improved search functionality, aiding navigation through 5,000 hours of live coverage for the Summer Olympics.

 Notably, Peacock's multiview feature is available on various platforms except mobile devices, due to screen size limitations. Even the biggest phone will run into issues when you try to play four streams at the same time on the same screen, unless you're willing to squint. Instead, it focuses on tablets and other platforms. The bigger the screen, the better, frankly—if you can watch it on a TV, that'd be probably best.

 The feature is now rolling out, so you'll certainly have it by the time the Olympics start. If you don't want to pay for Peacock, some local NBC affiliates will cover some disciplines at the Olympics, so [all you need is your antenna](https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-a-non-functioning-steelseries-arctis-pro-microphone-complete-solution/).
