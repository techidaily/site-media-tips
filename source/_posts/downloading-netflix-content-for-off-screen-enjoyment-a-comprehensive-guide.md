 Downloads on Netflix allow you to load several titles onto your device and watch them offline. This comes in handy if you're going off the grid, flying on a plane, or planning a trip where you might not have a solid internet connection. We'll show you how to download movies and TV shows on Netflix.

##  What You Need to Know About Downloading Videos on Netflix

 Downloads are supported on all Netflix plans, but there are limitations. In the Standard and ad-supported plans, you can only download titles on two devices at a time. On the Premium plan, it's six devices at a time.

 Also, you can only download titles on supported devices. Popular ones include Android, iPhone, iPad, Windows 10 and 11, and some smart TVs. The Mac and web versions of Netflix do not allow downloads.

 Also, these titles will consume storage space on your device, so ensure you have enough space to accommodate them. Once downloaded, the movies and shows will be available to all Netflix profiles on that device, and anyone with access can view them offline.

 You won't be able to watch your downloads if a title expires (this happens to all titles after some time) or leaves the service. If it is the former, delete the video and redownload it to renew it. If it is the latter, you have to wait until it returns to the service to download it again.

##  How to Download Netflix Movies on the Netflix Mobile App

 To download titles on a mobile device, you will need the [Netflix Android app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU217663/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.mediaclient&hl=en) or [Netflix iPhone or iPad app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/netflix/id363590051). Once you install it and log in, select the movie or show and tap the “Download” button.

 If it’s a show, it will download the first episode of the season. However, you can select specific episodes to download by scrolling down to the "Episodes" section and tapping the down arrow next to the ones you want to download.

 You can download more than one video simultaneously. And if you fail to download some titles, restart the Netflix app or update it to see if that fixes the issue.

##  How to Watch Downloaded Titles

 To find the downloaded movies and series, head to My Netflix > Downloads. Here, you can select the titles you want to watch.

##  How to Delete and Manage Downloads on Netflix

 Videos take up a lot of space in your phone’s memory. You can delete them to clear space for other things if you're done watching them.

 To delete a downloaded movie or show, head to My Netflix > Downloads. Swipe the video you want to delete to the left and tap the “X” button in the menu.

 You can also download lower-quality videos if you want to save space on your device but still want to download movies and shows.

 To do that, tap “My Netflix” and tap the hamburger menu (three horizontal lines) in the top-right corner. Then, select “App Settings” in the menu.

Close 

 In the Downloads section, tap “Video Quality” and set it to “Standard” on the next screen.
