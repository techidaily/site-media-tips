## Affordable High-Fidelity Audio: Discover the New, Reduced Rates for Streaming on Tidal's HiFi Platform

Tidal announced that it's doing away with its most expensive HiFi Plus option and rolling all those features into one plan for $11 a month starting April 10th. When was the last time you heard of a subscription service getting cheaper instead of more expensive? Here's what you need to know.

 Audiophiles looking for the best possible audio experience could pay $19.99 monthly for Tidal HiFi Plus, delivering lossless hi-res music, spatial audio, FLAC files, Dolby Atmos, and more, all ad-free. Or, for a normal music experience similar to the competition, the regular HiFi plan was $10.99 a month.

 Starting on April 10th, 2024, both plans will disappear entirely in favor of a single "Tidal" plan with all the best features, ad-free music, and hi-res goodies for the [same $10.99 a month price tag](https://support.tidal.com/hc/en-us/articles/23008953804945-Upcoming-Changes-to-TIDAL-Subscriptions). It's a pretty impressive move that lets the company match Apple and [Amazon Music](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-for-social-media-savants-distinguishing-between-igtv-and-youtube/).

 Basically, your Tidal experience is about to get better or more affordable, depending on your current plan. However, it's not all good news, as Tidal's free tier is being discontinued, and anyone taking advantage of it will need to switch to a paid subscription or lose access. Additionally, it'll no longer offer military or first responder discounts, but anyone on a discounted plan can continue enjoying it until June 10th. Thankfully, the Tidal Family plan is sticking around for $16.99 per month, along with the Student rate of $4.99.

 And finally, the other important change is for those taking advantage of Tidal's DJ software extension or tools. The DJ integrations will be an additional $9 monthly, bringing accounts back to $20\. "If you have used the DJ integration feature within the last 90 days, your account was kept at the $19.99 USD rate to ensure uninterrupted access to our suite of DJ integrations."

 Tidal notes that it's not removing the DJ content from any accounts, so if you wish to stop using them and enjoy the new standard plan for $10.99 a month, you'll need to manually remove it at[account.tidal.com](https://account.tidal.com/) before the new plans launch on April 10th.
