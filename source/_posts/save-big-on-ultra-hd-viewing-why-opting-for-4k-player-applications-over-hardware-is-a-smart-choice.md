Since 4K haven't yet conquer the market –4K video sources quite limited, 4K blu-ray discs far away from launching the DVD-renting store, [Apple TV 4 refusing to provide 4K streaming](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/), and most of all, the price for a 4K TV still hovering high beyond our reach, it is not hard to see that investing in 4K is like throwing gold into the bottomless abyss without even an echo.
