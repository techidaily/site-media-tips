## Part 1\. WhatsApp Video Specifications

 Before diving into WhatsApp video conversion tools, let's understand the platformâ€™s specifications.

 WhatsApp primarily supports MP4 format with H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec. While other formats like 3GP, AVI, and MKV might work, they are automatically converted to MP4 upon sending. WhatsApp automatically adjusts the resolution based on the video size and internet speed. However, the highest supported resolution is generally 720p.

 The current maximum video size for sending on WhatsApp is 16MB. This limit ensures smooth delivery and prevents overwhelming recipients with large files. Videos can be up to 2 minutes long for individual chats and 1 minute 30 seconds for group chats. That helps maintain efficient data usage and avoid overloading recipients with long videos. WhatsApp automatically compresses videos to meet size limits, sometimes impacting quality. Longer videos exceeding 3 minutes are split into segments.

## Part 3\. Solutions for WhatsApp Can't Send This Video

 WhatsApp, the ubiquitous messaging platform, allows seamless communication through text, images, and even video. But have you ever encountered the dreaded canâ€™t send this video message when trying to share a video?

 Check the video file size, format, duration, and more to ensure it fits WhatsAppâ€™s specifications. A weak internet connection can hinder video uploads. You can switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data (if allowed) or try finding a stronger signal to ensure a stable connection.

 Sometimes, a simple app restart or update can fix temporary glitches causing upload issues. Close and reopen WhatsApp. If the issue persists, check for updates, and install them to ensure smooth functioning. Try clearing the WhatsApp cache to free up space and potentially resolve issues. If none of these solutions work, reach out to WhatsApp's support team for further assistance.
