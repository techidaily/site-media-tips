## Part 1\. WhatsApp Video Specifications

 Before diving into WhatsApp video conversion tools, let's understand the platform’s specifications.

 WhatsApp primarily supports MP4 format with H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec. While other formats like 3GP, AVI, and MKV might work, they are automatically converted to MP4 upon sending. WhatsApp automatically adjusts the resolution based on the video size and internet speed. However, the highest supported resolution is generally 720p.

 The current maximum video size for sending on WhatsApp is 16MB. This limit ensures smooth delivery and prevents overwhelming recipients with large files. Videos can be up to 2 minutes long for individual chats and 1 minute 30 seconds for group chats. That helps maintain efficient data usage and avoid overloading recipients with long videos. WhatsApp automatically compresses videos to meet size limits, sometimes impacting quality. Longer videos exceeding 3 minutes are split into segments.

 WhatsApp, the ubiquitous messaging platform, allows seamless communication through text, images, and even video. But have you ever encountered the dreaded can’t send this video message when trying to share a video?

If none of these solutions work, reach out to WhatsApp's support team for further assistance.
