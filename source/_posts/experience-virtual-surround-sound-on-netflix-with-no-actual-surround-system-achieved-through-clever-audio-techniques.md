 When you see Netflix in the news, the buzz tends to be about rising subscription prices, but rarely do the platform's technical features cause much of a stir. However, I'm here to inform you that if you've been pining for more immersive audio, you ought to check out Netflix's spatial sound function.

##  What is Netflix's Spatial Sound Setting?

 Netlfix's spatial sound isn't new—[it launched in 2021](https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-adobe-premiere-top-6-tricks-for-professional-grade-videos/)—but it's been a gradual and steady forward march as the studio continues producing videos that support this feature. Now, they offer a strong lineup of shows and movies that allow subscribers to take advantage of this fascinating new technology.

 Essentially, [spatial audio](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-pattern-locks-are-unsafe-secure-your-samsung-galaxy-a14-5g-phone-now-with-these-tips-by-drfone-android/) is a sound-enhancing software that manipulates regular stereo speakers to simulate surround sound. This feat is accomplished through digital audio filters that adjust frequencies, making them appear as if you're listening to sounds happening at 360 degrees.

 For example, say you hit play on a movie about trains, and it features a scene where the train bursts onscreen from the left and moves off to the right. Regular audio would play equally as loud on either side through the whole sequence. However, with spatial audio, the noise is emphasized to be louder starting on the left side, simulating that sudden onscreen burst. Then, as the train moves off to the right, the volume fades beginning furthest to the left and tapers off to the right.

 That, in a nutshell, is spatial audio, but Netflix offers an even more immersive feature for headphone users: Head Tracking features. With these tracking features on, sensors detect head movements and alter audio based on the angle and direction of the listener's head. Here, if you crane your head to look in the direction of on-screen objects, the sound would alter, getting louder or quieter depending on the orientation of your head, just like in real life.

##  What Do I Need to Use Spatial Sound?

 Spatial audio is a fascinating feature, but it comes with asterisks. Here's a list of everything required to set yourself up for success.

###  Upgrade to Premium

 First and foremost, without a [premium subscription](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926), you can't access spatial audio features or content. Whether the extra \~$8 over the standard plan is worth it depends on your listening preferences and if you care to recreate the most lifelike audio possible. In my experience, spatial sound significantly improves movies with sweeping scores and intricate noise production, while in more subdued, dialogue-heavy movies, it's really not that noticeable.

###  Check Device Compatibility

 Even with a premium subscription, you may not be able to use spatial audio because it requires a compatible listening device and video player (TV, tablet, or smartphone). The good news is checking is simple—Netflix offers a dedicated list of [spatial audio-compatible devices](http://help.netflix.com/en/node/126405#:~:text=Netflix%20spatial%20audio%20is%20available%20on%20the%20Premium,equipment.%20It%20works%20on%20all%20Netflix%20supported%20devices.). And remember, only advanced headphones and earbuds will come equipped with head-tracking sensors, so if you sport an older pair of headphones, you probably won't be able to use that feature either.

###  Update Netflix Software

 Before you sit down with your bucket, bag, or tin of popcorn, check to ensure your Netflix app is up-to-date with the latest software. If you don't have the latest updates, there's a chance the spatial audio won't work.

Netflix

 Only certain Netflix shows and movies were produced to support spatial audio. Which, of course, prompts the question: What can I watch? I could list them all now, but the list is only growing. So, to check if your desired TV or movie will work, simply use the search feature in the Netflix app and type in "Spatial Audio." From there, you'll find a library of compatible content—look for the Spatial Audio icon (above). Some popular titles that include Spatial Audio are Stranger Things, The Watcher, Wednesday, and Knives Out: Glass Onion.
