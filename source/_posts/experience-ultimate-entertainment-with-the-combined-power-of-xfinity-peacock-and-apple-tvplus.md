## Experience Ultimate Entertainment with the Combined Power of Xfinity, Peacock & Apple TV+

###  UPDATE: 2024/05/29 16:15 EST BY CORBIN DAVENPORT

**_Bundle Now Available_** 

 Xfinity Internet or TV customers can now [purchase the StreamSaver bundle](https://www.xfinity.com/learn/digital-cable-tv/streaming-services) for their account for $15 per month. The original article follows below.

 Comcast is preparing to launch a streaming bundle that includes Peacock, Netflix, and Apple TV+. The bundle launches in late May or early June and will be exclusively offered to Comcast broadband and TV customers.

 The bundle, dubbed "StreamSaver," will stand at a "vastly reduced price" when compared to other streaming packages. However, pricing hasn't been revealed, and Comcast hasn't announced whether the bundle will include ad-free or ad-supported streaming memberships. Ideally, Comcast will provide both ad-free and ad-supported tiers.

 Most major ISPs, including Comcast, pull double-duty as cable and cellular providers. Now that cable TV is in a death spiral, these ISPs are attempting to become streaming distributors. They will offer cable-like streaming bundles that include multiple services at a reduced price. Eventually, ISP-made bundles may become the only way to access certain streaming platforms.

> “We’ve been bundling video successfully and creatively for 60 years … This is the latest iteration of that. And I think this will be a pretty compelling package.”

 Brian Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast, acknowledges that this bundle is a descendent of cable television, calling it the "latest iteration" in a 60-year history of selling video packages.

 Of course, Disney+, Hulu, and Max just announced a [joint streaming bundle](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-sharex-unmasked-critical-insights-and-substitutes/) for the summer of 2024\. The Walt Disney Company claims that streaming bundles bring in more customers and reduce cancelations. This may be due to rising prices in streaming. In any case, if a streaming platform _wants_ to make money, it needs to be bundle-ified. We should expect to see more streaming partnerships, packages, and bundles throughout the year.

 Comcast says its new Peacock, Netflix, and Apple TV+ bundle will arrive in late May or early June. Pricing hasn't been revealed, though the bundle will supposedly arrive at a "vastly reduced price." A price of less than $20 each month seems like a good guess, as the ad-supported versions of these services normally cost a total of $23 each month when purchased individually (ignoring [Peacock's](https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-precision-in-performance-utilizing-social-blade-for-youtube-data/) upcoming price hike, which will take the figure to $25 a month).
