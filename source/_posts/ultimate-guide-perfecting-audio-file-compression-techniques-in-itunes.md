## Part 1\. 4 Crucial Reminder Before Selecting a Background Noise Canceling Microphone

### 1\. Directionality

 It refers to the directional sensitivity of a microphone from the sound coming from different directions. There are different types of directional microphones, and each has its characteristics. Here are the samples you need to know:

| Type of Directionality Microphone      | Short Description                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Omnidirectional Microphones            | Pick up all sounds equally in all directions. Best for recording ambient sound and sense of space recording.                             |
| Cardioid or Unidirectional Microphones | They are the most sensitive to the sound coming from the front but different from other sides. Commonly used for vocals and instruments. |
| Bidirectional or Figure Microphones    | Equally, pick up all sounds from the front and rear but not on the sides. Best for recording interviews.                                 |
| Shotgun Microphones                    | Pick up a sound from a narrow beam before the microphone. Best for recording dialogs in film and TV production.                          |

### 2\. Connection

 It is essential to know the connection of your microphone, whether it is a USB, XLR, or 3.5mm jack suitable for your recording setup. Without the compatibility connector, even if you purchase the most expensive one, you can't use a reduced background noise microphone if the connector isn't compatible.

### 3\. Size

 Size does matter when it comes to the microphone. However, some microphones that are large enough aren't compatible with the setup you have made.

## Part 5\. FAQs on the Noise Canceling Microphones

[Noise canceling](https://tools.techidaily.com/) is the process of reducing, minimizing, or eliminating that are generated from natural causes or electrical causes.

But if you are on a tight budget, you can still purchase a low-cost microphone that offers the same noise canceling, but some mics aren't too effective in recording without noise, unlike the expensive ones.
