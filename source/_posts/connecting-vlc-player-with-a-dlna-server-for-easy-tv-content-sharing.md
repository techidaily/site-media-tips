### How to Let VLC Access Media Files from Other Devices?

Here, VLC media player plays a role of [DLNA player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/dlna/) to play media contents from other DLNA-devices, including your phone and television. By activating the DLNA/UPnP function, you can easily access the files available on other devices via VLC.
