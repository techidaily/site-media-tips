## Expert Strategies for Converting WMV to GIFs: Top Techniques to Master Now

## How to Convert WMV to GIF: Best Desktop/Online Converters

 Why do you need to**convert WMV to GIF** ? One reason is the limited platform supported for the WMV format. Microsoft developed it to store various information, such as video clips, movies, animations, and audio data. The lack of platform support prevents WMV from being shared with others unless you convert it to another format.

 By converting it to a GIF, you can preserve all the frames in a smaller file and share it on any other social media platform.

 Now, try the following converters that will turn your WMV files into high-quality GIFs.
