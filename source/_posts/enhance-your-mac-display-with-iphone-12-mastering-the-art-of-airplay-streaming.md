In addition to the powerful iSight on iPhone 5/5s, new features like the option to capture 1080p HD at 60 fps, 240-fps slo-mo, and time-lapse video are added for iPhone6/6s iSight, which empowers you to shoot HD videos and then share you stunning results with friends on a bigger screen. Yet, not knowing how to share your videos with lossless image quality is probably gonna sound really lame. Apart from using iTunes on Mac as a common AirPlay receiver, here in this article, we will introduce you the powerful [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) to let you AirPlay on iPhone videos to Mac with the best visual experience. 

Peer-to-peer AirPlay enables iPhone to AirPlay directly to Mac, even if your Mac and iPhone are not in the same wifi network. 

* Peer-to-peer AirPlay requires a Mac (2012 or later) with OS X Yosemite or an iOS device (late 2012 or later) with iOS 9; and an Apple TV (3rd generation rev A, model A1469 or later) with Apple TV software 7.0 or later.
* Have both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on.  
 However, what if your Mac system is OS X Leopard or OS X Snow Leopard lower than 10.6.x? Peer-to-peer AirPlay would be quite demanding.

And even if you can use the peer-to-peer feature and iTunes to stream your contents, you still need 5KPlayer freeware in particular to stream your family movies, travel videos, gag reels, and other fascinating video clips with Ultra HD playback quality and realize AirPlay from your iPhone5/iPhone6/iPhone 6s to Mac.

It is an all-in-one media player that basically satisfies your all-round demands and preferences. And it is the best solution to AirPlay your iPhone (12) videos and video clips to Mac.
