Apple's intelligent set-top box - Apple TV is just another salient gadget that lets you release 200% the potential of your HDTV's display. Pay $129 for a 4th-gen Apple TV, and you'll be able to, not only connect iPad to TV, [watch 2019 NBA playoffs on Apple TV](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/), but also seek through a wide variety of Apple TV exclusive APPs. 

**How to Mirror iPad Pro 2 to Apple TV?**

**Step 1:** Skip this step if you already have hooked up Apple's set-top box to your HDTV, yet if you haven't, follow this official instruction on Apple TV: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205358  
**Step 2:** Update your tvOS to the latest version, and connect it to the same Wi-Fi as your iPad Pro does.  
**Step 3:** Now enable AirPlay mirroring under the control center of an iPad to help it recognize Apple TV.   
**Step 4:** Select a video to play from iPad to Apple TV, or beam the screen of a game APP on Apple TV. 

**Tips and Notes:**  
 1\. If the very Apple TV you attempt to connect to has a 4-digit onscreen code restricting AirPlay requests, find out the onscreen code and type it to the TV; You iPad will then be asked to give a passcode to access the TV, for once or for long, and you'll need to write down the code in case.  
 2\. By default, you may not get a full-screen iPad screen mirroring as the target display leverages the aspect ratio of its content sender by default, aka 4:3 on an iPad Pro 2, so a few adaptions need to be made to stretch the images to full screen.   
 To fix that, please visit on your TV: Settings > Audio & Video > Adjust for AirPlay overscan, which helps you watch iPad on TV with the best possible ratio.
