## Chromecast iPhone Gaining Credits

**Release of Your iPhone during iPhone Casting**

After Chromecast videos, etc. the iPhone is not used anymore for the duration, meaning no battery consumption.

## Updated Chromcast iPhone/iPad App New Features Missing

When you apply your iPhone iOS9/8 as the Chromecast remote controller, you may as well find some disappointments. The new features Google promised in updated Chromecast app for iOS are not there even though Apple app store posts to be so. The two parties are both responsible for this lack, but surely, this update will be worked out soon as many iOS customers are complaining. This iPhone Chromecast app will work as the previous Chromecast generation always has, but without Content search, voice search, and the new 'What's on,' 'Devices' and 'Get Apps' options. 

You can now transmit data files via Chromecast from iPhone/iPad, Android and computers to the receiver –HDTV. 5KPlayer, though unable to directly connect to Chromecast for data transmission, its built-in AirPlay function can be acted as the complementary of Chromecast –streaming from iPhone to computer, computers to computers, and computer to HDTV, which sets both computer and TV as the data receiver.
