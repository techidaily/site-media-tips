## Chromecast iPhone Gaining Credits

**Release of Your iPhone during iPhone Casting**

After Chromecast videos, etc. the iPhone is not used anymore for the duration, meaning no battery consumption.

## Updated Chromcast iPhone/iPad App New Features Missing

When you apply your iPhone iOS9/8 as the Chromecast remote controller, you may as well find some disappointments.
