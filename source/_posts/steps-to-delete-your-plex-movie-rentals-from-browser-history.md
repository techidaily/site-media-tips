## Steps to Delete Your Plex Movie Rentals From Browser History

### Key Takeaways

* Plex added movie rentals in February 2023, but you can easily block these results from search.
* You can turn off movie rentals on one device, and the setting will apply to all devices you use Plex on.
* To turn off movie rentals, click the filter icon next to the search bar and toggle off "Available to Rent on Plex."

 Plex is a phenomenal service for cataloging your media library, streaming from a collection of free movies and shows, and even watching live TV. However, you may not have movie rentals in mind when using Plex, and we'll show you how to block those results from search.

[In February 2023, Plex officially added movie rentals](https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/honest-scholarship-steering-clear-from-chatgpt-dependence/). The service works essentially the same as on any movie rental streaming platform, and it's available in the Plex apps on every device. Many people use Plex specifically because it's not a movie rental platform, but the rentals appear in search alongside everything else. The good news is it's simple to turn off those results and never be bothered by rentals again.

 The cool thing about this is you only need to do it on one device and it will be applied to everywhere you use Plex. We'll first show the [desktop version of Plex](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001939/https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/?cat=plex+desktop&plat=windows#plex-app): start typing into the search bar or click into it. Select the filter icon on the right side of the search bar.

 Turn off "Available to Rent on Plex" from the menu.

 If you prefer to do it on a mobile device, open Plex for [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/plex-watch-live-tv-and-movies/id383457673) or [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001939/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plexapp.android&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) and tap the search icon.

 That's all there is to it! While it may be mildly annoying to some that Plex has become a movie rental service, at least it's not too prominent. And as mentioned, you won't need to toggle off "Available to Rent on Plex" every time you install Plex on a new device.
