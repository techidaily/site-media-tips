Pandora, a website employed by millions of people every day to appreciate music they love. Musicological "DNA" is adopted to craft personalized stations with constant listener feedback from a growing collection of more than one million tracks. Pandora is my app of choice for on-demand music. What if to **AirPlay Pandora music from iPhone/iPad/iPod to Mac** with better amplifiers even professional stereos? As an AirPlay enabled app, it is feasible. AirPlay is primarily intended for streaming media, and it does that quite well. Even so, some programs offer a better experience to AirPlay Pandora than others.

As a big fan of music, Pandora users have an extra incentive to upgrade their auditory input quality. AirPlay Mirroring from Pandora to Mac takes advantage of the hardware capabilities of Macs to deliver high-quality audios while maintaining optimal overall performance of iDevices. When you're navigating the iDevices' home screen, launching Pandora or trying to use Pandora that have audio files, there's no noticeable lag while playing. [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) attempts to make it easier than ever to [AirPlay music](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/)from apps like Pandora and it succeeds in doing so.

We're all about [AirPlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) these days, as we have been since Apple launched it. AirPlay unites the best sources for music (Pandora) with better speakers (sound speakers connected to a Mac), the larger screen (the Mac), and the best remote control (your iPhone, iPad or iPod). For example, you can press the media bar to remotely end the current AirPlay session of Pandora. While Mac AirPlay Mirroring is simple to use, how it works can cause some confusion and lead some users to believe it's not working at all. And 5KPlayer is designed with the capability to easily handle the exact problems mentioned above once and for all.
