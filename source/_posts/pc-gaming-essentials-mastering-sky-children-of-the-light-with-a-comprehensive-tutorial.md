#### **Why Is Sky: Children of the Light PC Search High?**

The celebrations and awards include but not limit to Best of 2019 iPhone Game of the Year, 2020 Apple Design Winner, Game Developers Choice Awards, 2020 Webby Award Winner, People’s Choice Mobile Games Award 2020 and 2020 Games for Change Awards Best Gameplay.

_"I've been playing this since May 30th 2020 and I have to say that no game compares." - Spazmatic Fanatic_ 
 _"One of my favorite games of all time. Everything is fantastic, and the graphics/music are beautiful. This is an extremely well done game and I praise TGC for all their hard work!" - Evelyn Smith_

I also downloaded this game on my iPhone and explored one chapter already. I have to say I love it and I hope it can have a Windows version. But based on the fact that the game is only available for iOS and Android at present, I have to use a different way. 5KPlayer, an [iOS game to PC mirroring](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) software, satisfies my curiosity about how it performs when playing Sky: Children of the Light on Windows PC. If you also want a try, just follow my step-by-step guide.

**Tips!**

You may have found there is another way suggested to help you download and play Sky: Children of the Light game on PC, that is installing iOS emulator to create a virtual iOS system on PC. It is indeed an option if there is no other choices. However, you should be told that the way has a complicated installation process, requires payment for premium version and sometimes may bring adware or malware to your computer.
