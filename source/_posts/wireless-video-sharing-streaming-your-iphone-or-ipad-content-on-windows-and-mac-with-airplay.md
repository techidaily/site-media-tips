 _Written by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21)_ | Last update: April 28, 2020

Although Microsoft is making great investment in the "Internet of Things" by flavoring its Windows 10 system with the IoT scenario for different category of devices, like Windows 10 Mobile for IoT mobile devices, this big breakthrough is yet to come, and we still have to rely on traditional convergence of Wireless technologies, MEMS and Internet to get information. **Apple Airplay** is part of the wireless technology that we need daily for the purpose of streaming information from devices to devices.

Apple AirPlay was once called AirTunes and used for audio only, but in iOS 4.2, Airtunes becomes AirPlay that can stream both videos and music. And later on, the AirPlay protocol stack was licensed as a third-party software component technology, which can be applied by many manufacturers, like iTunes and [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/).

Nevertheless, despite the efforts of all the manufacturers to produce AirPlay-enabled APPs/devices, it's still primarily an Apple-tagged feature. Besides, though iPhones and iPads of Apple company have already prevailed in the market and almost anyone can afford at least one of them, the expensive Mac is less likely to gain the same heat of popularity. Here comes the problem, How do I use Apple AirPlay just on a PC? We recommend you 5KPlayer.
