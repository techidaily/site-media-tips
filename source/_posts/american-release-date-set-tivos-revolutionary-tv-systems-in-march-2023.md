## American Release Date Set: TiVo's Revolutionary TV Systems in March 2023

Xperi Inc, the company behind the TiVo brand, announced during its second quarter earnings call that a new line of televisions powered by the company's TiVo OS media platform will be arriving stateside in the spring of 2025.

 "Our growing TiVo OS and video-over-broadband footprint is setting the stage for future monetization, and we expect this will be a core element of our long-term revenue growth and margin expansion,” Jon Kirchner, CEO of Xperi, [said during the call](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240805730607/en/Xperi-Inc.-Announces-Second-Quarter-2024-Results/). He pointed to connected TV advertising, "where we offer our TiVo media platform to power smart TVs and other broadband devices and monetize their usage," as well as in-vehicle entertainment and its TiVo video-over-broadband service, as the company's "three key growth opportunities."

 Kircher also noted that smart TVs powered by TiVo are already available in 15 countries across Europe, including France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Turkey. The company has partnered with six manufacturers: Vestel, Skyworth, Sharp, Argos, and Panasonic (which joined up in May) to produce sets under 17 different brands such as Daewoo, Regal, Hitachi, Telefunken and JVC. The company announced during the call that it has now partnered with a seventh manufacturer to launch TVs “Powered by TiVo” in the U.S. in 2025, though the company did not directly identify its new partner, only describing them as "a top 5 supplier of smart TVs into the U.S. market." The company also revealed that it "remains on track to achieve two million active connected devices" by the end of the year.

 TiVo's service has evolved extensively since the debut of its set-top DVR technology in 1999\. Where the original DVR service provided you with an on-screen guide of scheduled broadcast and cable programming, as well as playback of downloaded shows, TiVo OS is a "[first-of-its-kind neutral platform](https://business.tivo.com/products-solutions/tivo-os)" that provides original equipment manufacturers a highly customizable Smart TV platform that is more flexible than those of rivals like [Roku](https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-infinix-hot-40-pro-frp-in-3-different-ways-by-drfone-android/), [Android TV](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/wondering-the-best-alternative-to-hola-on-apple-iphone-6s-plus-here-is-the-answer-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/), or [LG's WebOS](https://howto.techidaily.com/9-solutions-to-fix-oppo-a78-system-crash-issue-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/). It enables OEMs to "own their brand experience and gain significantly more control on how viewers consume content." The OS offers simplified content discovery with personalized recommendations and voice navigation features from streaming sources including Netflix, HBO Max, CBS All Access, Tubi, Google Play, Disney+, Pluto TV, STARZ, VUDU, PBS, and Peacock.
