### Part 3: JBL L8 - 2-Way AirPlay Audio Receiver That Matters

![JBL AirPlay audio receiver](https://www.5kplayer.com/airplay/img/5k-airplay-speakers-yxt-102401.png) 

**Price:** $499.95

**Specs:** Wireless AirPlay, DLNA and Bluetooth support  
Send out full-range JBL sound at 120-watts  
Require a JBL Music Flow mobile APP to control remotely  
Uplift audio quality of compressed music files with Clari-Fi DSP  
Support wireless charging

**Pros:** L8 AirPlay audio receiver is revolutionary, it's probably the best ever speaker that cuts off all wires, cables or strings, just as is described "Leave those tangled wires in the attic where they belong". It's somewhat difficult to relate JBL L8 to its performance by looking at its cliche design, yet it's just such a blend of the legendary JBL Century L100 and the cutting-edge AirPlay audio streaming technology, and integrates them well. Indeed, cost for this AirPlay audio receiver isn't really friendly, but most users wouldn't think so by the time they unbox the wooden-enclosed speaker, and installed the free JBL music flow APP to remotely decide the music playback from an Android or iOS device. JBL AirPlay audio receiver has the transducers and acoustic design that can deliver amazing sound from a compact speaker. It's also one-point better than the rest of the speaker with its automatic format conversion capability, working with any music formay that you throw at it. 

Have you made up your mind as of which AirPlay audio speaker is the cup of tea? Congratulations if you can end up search here, for the above-recommended AirPlay audio speakers prove to be both enduring and behaving, and you can always pick up the one within budget, but if you decide to visit some AirPlay forums or second-hand market to see if there're some bargains out there, take you time to find out one.
