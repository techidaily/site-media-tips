## Max Out Your Savings: Discover the Enhanced Benefits of DoorDash DashPass!

Local delivery service DoorDash and online streaming service Max, which is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, have announced that they are partnering to provide a complimentary Max with Ads subscription to DoorDash's DashPass annual plan, in what they're touting as a "first-ever streaming benefit."

 DashPass subscribers in the U.S. will gain access to "exclusive original series, blockbuster movies and documentaries as well as a library of beloved TV from leading brands like HBO, Warner Bros., A24, Adult Swim, ID and the DC Universe," through Max with Ads, the companies announced on Wednesday. Titles include “House of the Dragon,” “The White Lotus,” “Friends,” “Godzilla x Kong” and “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” as well as original series such as “The Penguin,” which is slated for release in September, and “Dune: Prophecy” coming in November.

 “Since launching DashPass six years ago, our goal has always been to deliver increasing value and savings to members,” Prabir Adarkar, President and CEO at DoorDash, said in a press statement. “Streaming and delivery go hand in hand, and we’re thrilled to launch a coveted benefit for DashPass Annual Plan members.”

 The companies were quick to point out that Max with Ads would cost you $100 each year, if purchased on its own, but can be had for the $96 that a DashPass annual plan retails for. You will also be able to upgrade to the ad-free tier of Max (which goes for $170 annually) for an additional $11 per month.

 "I think for Max, we felt it had a really strong catalog for both families and adults," DoorDash chief marketing officer Kofi Amoo-Gottfried told _Variety_. “And if you really think about the base of who makes up the DashPass audience, we felt the titles and the IP and the things that existed on Max would allow us to speak to that audience in a way that would really resonate. A lot of it is really about understanding who that customer is and what we think is going to appeal to them.”

 While this is the first time that DoorDash has offered its customers tie-in benefits with entertainment platforms, other streaming services have attempted similar promotions in the past. Walmart, for example, [offers a complimentary Paramount+ Essential Plan](https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=e7eab128eb8d1c53e14db14f4c632447&cuid=UUhtgUeUpU2004861&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus%2Fparamount-video-streaming) with its Walmart+ membership, as has [Instacart+ with NBC's Peacock](https://www.instacart.com/help/section/360007797952/21190821634324). Conversely, in 2023, [Roku offered six-months of free DashPass to its users](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-realme-c53-location-on-skout-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/).
