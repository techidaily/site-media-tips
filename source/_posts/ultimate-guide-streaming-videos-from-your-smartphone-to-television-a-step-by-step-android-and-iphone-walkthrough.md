### 3\. Stream Video from Android to TV Using HDMI Cable

It may sound cool to connect your phone to TV wirelessly. However, wireless streaming isn't always the best option, especially when your WIFI network doesn't offer a strong signal. Plus, there's the cost of buying a wireless receiver, such as the $35 Google Chromecast and the 69$-199$ Apple TV. And for older mobile devices, wireless streaming may not be an option at all. Given that, you'd better consider HDMI.

![Connect Android to TV HDMI](https://www.5kplayer.com/airplay/img/connect-smartphone-with-tv.jpg) 

To play video from phone to TV using HDMI, you'll need:

* An HDTV having HDMI ports. You can check your manufacturer's website to see if your TV is HDMI-compliant.
* An [HDMI cable](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-hdmi-cables/) or adapter that allows you to connect your phone to TV.

Then the only thing you should do is to connect your Android to TV with the HDMI cable and choose right HDMI source according to TV settings. After that, you can watch videos from your phone on TV.

### 2\. Play video from iPhone to TV with USB Cable

**Step 1.** Connect the Digital AV adapter to your iPhone.

#### **Consider This: Get a DLNA TV**

If you're considering a new TV, look for the DLNA-certified one that'll communicate with your phone or tablet easily, because a DLNA-certified phone such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 or HTC One M9 can connect to a DLNA TV, Xbox One, projector or set-top box, when you link them to your home Wi-Fi. And, best of all, there's nothing between your phone and TV for no wires needed and no streaming gadget required in order to play video from phone to TV. 

**Check if your device is DLNA complied:**
