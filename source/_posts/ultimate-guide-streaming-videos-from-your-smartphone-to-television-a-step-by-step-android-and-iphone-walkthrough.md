### 3\. Stream Video from Android to TV Using HDMI Cable

It may sound cool to connect your phone to TV wirelessly. However, wireless streaming isn't always the best option, especially when your WIFI network doesn't offer a strong signal. Plus, there's the cost of buying a wireless receiver, such as the $35 Google Chromecast and the 69$-199$ Apple TV. And for older mobile devices, wireless streaming may not be an option at all. Given that, you'd better consider HDMI.

To play video from phone to TV using HDMI, you'll need:

* An HDTV having HDMI ports. You can check your manufacturer's website to see if your TV is HDMI-compliant.
* An [HDMI cable](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-hdmi-cables/) or adapter that allows you to connect your phone to TV.

Then the only thing you should do is to connect your Android to TV with the HDMI cable and choose right HDMI source according to TV settings. After that, you can watch videos from your phone on TV.
