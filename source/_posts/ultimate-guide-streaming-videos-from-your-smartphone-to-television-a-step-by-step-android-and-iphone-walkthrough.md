### 3\. Stream Video from Android to TV Using HDMI Cable

It may sound cool to connect your phone to TV wirelessly. However, wireless streaming isn't always the best option, especially when your WIFI network doesn't offer a strong signal.

Given that, you'd better consider HDMI.

To play video from phone to TV using HDMI, you'll need:

* An HDTV having HDMI ports. You can check your manufacturer's website to see if your TV is HDMI-compliant.
* An [HDMI cable](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-hdmi-cables/) or adapter that allows you to connect your phone to TV.

Then the only thing you should do is to connect your Android to TV with the HDMI cable and choose right HDMI source according to TV settings. After that, you can watch videos from your phone on TV.

### 2\. Play video from iPhone to TV with USB Cable

It couldn't be easier to connect iPhone to TV via [Lightning Digital AV Adapter](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202044), and most of the iPhone video apps like Netflix, Hulu, HBO GO and NFL Mobile support this USB cable setup. So it's really a good way to stream video from iPhone to TV. 

**Step 1.** Connect the Digital AV adapter to your iPhone.

**Step 2.** Connect the HDMI cable between your TV and Digital AV adapter.

**Step 3.** Play the video on your iPhone.

#### **Consider This: Get a DLNA TV**

If you're considering a new TV, look for the DLNA-certified one that'll communicate with your phone or tablet easily, because a DLNA-certified phone such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 or HTC One M9 can connect to a DLNA TV, Xbox One, projector or set-top box, when you link them to your home Wi-Fi. And, best of all, there's nothing between your phone and TV for no wires needed and no streaming gadget required in order to play video from phone to TV. 

**Check if your device is DLNA complied:**
