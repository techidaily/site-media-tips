**Method 2\. iPhone to Mac AirPlay with [AirServer](https://www.airserver.com/)**

• 30-day trail free. Educational License ($7.99 - $11.99). Consumer License ($19.99). Business License ($39.99)  
 • Compatible with macOS 10.9 (Mavericks) to macOS 11.0 (Big Sur)  
 • Compatible with iPhone 4s or newer, iOS 7 to iOS 14

In 2011, AirServer introduced world’s first AirPlay receiver for Mac with audio streaming, then starting its road to full-scale media streaming and screen mirroring between devices. With the built-in AirPlay function, it helps education, home entertainment, gaming, business and live streaming much easier than before. Specifically, you can cast learning stuff from iPhone to Mac connected with a projector, so that the classroom is in your hands. You can control the class just using your portable device of choice but without the need to wandering in the room all the time. Or you can stream audio, play movies/music on big screen, and photos with friends and family. Similar to 5KPlayer, it can also help live stream YouTube, cast games and [record iPhone screens](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/).
