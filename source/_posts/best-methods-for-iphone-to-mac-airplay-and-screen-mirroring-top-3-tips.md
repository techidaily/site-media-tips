**Method 2\. iPhone to Mac AirPlay with [AirServer](https://www.airserver.com/)**

• 30-day trail free. Educational License ($7.99 - $11.99). Consumer License ($19.99). Business License ($39.99)  
 • Compatible with macOS 10.9 (Mavericks) to macOS 11.0 (Big Sur)  
 • Compatible with iPhone 4s or newer, iOS 7 to iOS 14

In 2011, AirServer introduced world’s first AirPlay receiver for Mac with audio streaming, then starting its road to full-scale media streaming and screen mirroring between devices. With the built-in AirPlay function, it helps education, home entertainment, gaming, business and live streaming much easier than before. Specifically, you can cast learning stuff from iPhone to Mac connected with a projector, so that the classroom is in your hands. You can control the class just using your portable device of choice but without the need to wandering in the room all the time. Or you can stream audio, play movies/music on big screen, and photos with friends and family. Similar to 5KPlayer, it can also help live stream YouTube, cast games and [record iPhone screens](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/).

**Method 3\. AirPlay from iPhone to Mac with [Reflector 4](https://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector)**

• Free for 7 days. License version for Mac (US$17.99)  
 • Compatible with macOS 10.15 or newer, iPhone SE to iPhone 12 Pro Max

A good AirPlay receiver should both support media streaming and screen mirroring, and Reflector 4 surely deserve a space. When used as a screen mirroring server, Reflector 4 helps control how and when mirrored devices are shared easily and safely with a safe code. Along with the AirPlay mirroring, you can record iPhone demo videos, walkthroughs and how-to tutorials up to 60fps. As for media streaming, Reflector 4 is also an expert doing well in AirPlay streaming home videos and movies to Mac wirelessly, and sharing photos on a larger screen. 

Hope the three methods mentioned above are workable for you. BTW, this year, VLC 4.0 with AirPlay support will be released.
