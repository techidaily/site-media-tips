### Troubleshoot iOS 15/14/13 AirPlay Problems

iOS 15/14 AirPlay mirroring helps you do streaming and allows you to display contents from your iOS 15/14/13 iPhone (12, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max, 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max)/iPad (Pro) on a bigger screen, but that can be achievable based on some prerequisites.

**★ Basic Requirements to Enable iOS 15/14/13 AirPlay:**

The two devices you want them to communicate with each other should support Apple AirPlay protocol, of course. Also, make sure that you have updated the software on the two devices to the latest iOS 15/14/13, like your iPhone 12, 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, iPad Pro, Apple TV, etc.

If all of the above requirements have been satisfied, but iOS 15/14/13 not mirroring problem still exists, try the following methods:  
 1\. Reboot rooter of your device, reset the network and turn off the Bluetooth.  
 2\. Check all the devices are on the same WiFi network.  
 3\. Make sure your iOS 15/14/13 device is near the device you try to screen mirroring to.

**★ Common Reasons for iOS 15/14/13 Screen Mirroring not Working Problem**

**1\. iOS 15/14/13 AirPlay not Working Because of the Software Update**  
 Sometimes, the iOS software update should be to blame though there is no clear explanation, but quite often AirPlay mirroring not working problem happens when the software gets update.  
 If iOS 15/14/13 software update causes the iOS 15/14/13 not screen mirroring error, you can try to force restart your iOS device > reset the network settings on your device in Settings > General > Reset, and then tap on Reset Network Settings.

**2\. Can't Enable iOS 15/14/13 Screen Mirroring because You Can't Access Control Center within Apps**  
 Sometimes, you may can't swipe up from the bottom of your device to access Control Center and use Screen Mirroring feature when you are using an app, it is probably because you have mistakenly turn off the "Access Within Apps" option on your device. To solve that, simply go to Settings on your iOS 15/14/13 device > Control Center > turn on Access Within Apps option.

**3\. iOS 15/14/13 Screen Mirroring not Working Occurs as Your Device Doesn't Support iOS 15/14/13**  
 It has been officially announced that iOS 15/14/13 is only available for iPhone 12, 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, iPhone XS, XS Max, XR, X, 8/8 Plus, 7/7 Plus, 6S/6S Plus, SE and iPod touch, while iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus will be stuck on iOS 12\. Therefore, there is no iOS 15/14/13 screen mirroring for you to choose from on these non-compatible iOS devices.  
 As for iPad models, we are not sure if all of the iPads will support AirPlay mirroring iOS 15/14/13 as the new operating system for iPads is named iPadOS. However, we have found that iPadOS is the typical iOS 15/14/13 for iPads and [iPadOS screen mirroring](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) function is the same as the iOS 15/14/13 screen mirroring, so you can enable iOS 15/14/13 screen mirroring on some iPads. To be specific, the 12.9-, 11-, 10.5- and 9.7-inch iPad Pro, iPad (sixth generation), iPad (fifth generation), iPad mini (fifth generation), iPad mini 4, iPad Air (third generation) and iPad Air 2 supports iPadOS as of now.
