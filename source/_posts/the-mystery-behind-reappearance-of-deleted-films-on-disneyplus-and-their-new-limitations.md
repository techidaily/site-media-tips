## The Mystery Behind Reappearance of Deleted Films on Disney+ and Their New Limitations

Not too long ago, Disney started [pulling some shows and movies from the Disney+ streaming service](https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-streamlining-windows-photos-with-customized-audio-and-visual-settings-for-2024/). The decision came off as confusing at best, since a lot of the content that was removed was specifically for the streaming service. It was also relatively recent stuff, too, with some of the shows and movies premiering on the platform just months before. It looks like a lot of that removed content is making its way to other platforms, with a catch.

 Disney has quietly re-released some of the original, made-for-Disney+ content that it pulled from the platform as part of the larger content purge that took place back in May. This means that if you want to watch some of the movies that were unceremoniously zapped from the platform, that is now a possibility outside of Disney+. This includes _Crater_, which enjoyed a high-profile launch just barely a month before it got removed, and other movies such as _Artemis Fowl_, _Stargirl_, and _The One And Only Ivan_.

 The only catch with this whole thing, however, and it's a big one, is that those movies are not actually becoming available on other streaming platforms. Instead, they are making their way to PVOD (premium video on demand) platforms such as Google TV, Amazon, and Vudu. This means that if you want to watch these movies, you'll have to either buy the movie for $20 or rent it for a limited time. While it's great that the movies aren't lost forever (outside of piracy) and you're actually able to watch those movies online again, it does mean that you need to pay for each individual movie, whether you actually want to own it or you want to watch it for a limited period.

 Unfortunately, the shows that Disney pulled from Disney+ have yet to show up on other platforms, only some of the movies. _The World According to Jeff Goldblum_ is still nowhere to be found, as well as the _Willow_ series from 2022 based on the classic 1988 film. The only way to watch most of those shows is piracy, since most of them were not released on Blu-ray or other formats before their removal from the Disney+ streaming service.
