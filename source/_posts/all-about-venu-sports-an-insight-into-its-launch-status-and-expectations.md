 Watching live sports through streaming services is a bit of a mess. Certain sports and networks are exclusive to certain packages, and everyone is left confused about where to watch the game. Venu Sports is a new streaming service that aims to fix that—and it has some big money behind it.

 On August 16th, the District Judge [granted a temporary injunction against Venu](https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-leave-a-life360-group-on-oneplus-ace-2-pro-without-anyone-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), pausing its launch. There's no word on how long this will last, and the long-term effects for Venu.

##  What Is Venu Sports?

 Traditionally, ESPN (Disney) and FOX have been like oil and water—you can get one or the other easily, but mixing them together takes effort ($$). [Venu Sports](http://venu.com) is a new service that aims to fix this by putting all the biggest sports networks under one roof.

 Of course, there are existing streaming services that do this. YouTube TV, Sling TV, Fubo TV, and some other live TV services include these channels. However, they also offer a lot more than sports, and you might not care about all that extra fluff. As the name implies, Venu Sports is all about sports.

 The other difference between Venu Sports and something like YouTube TV is who's in charge. Venu is a joint venture from Disney, FOX, and Warner Bros. Discovery. The companies responsible for the channels are running the service—which is why it's pending regulatory approval. If all goes well, it will launch this Fall.

 As mentioned, Venu Sports is the child of Disney, FOX, and Warner Bros. Discovery. These three giants have many sports networks under their umbrella. Here's what each one brings to the table for Venu:

* **Disney**: ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, SECN, ACCN, ESPNEWS, and ESPN+
* **FOX**: FOX, FS1, FS2, and Big Ten Network
* **Warner Bros. Discovery**: TNT, TBS and TruTV

##  How Much Will Venu Sports Cost?

 In August 2024, it was [confirmed](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/resolved-issue-addressed-persistent-app-failures-for-wot-blitz-users/) that Venu Sports will cost $42.99 per month after a seven-day free trial. However, that is only an entry price. People who sign up for Venu at $42.99 a month will get to keep the price for 12 months, after which it will presumably increase.

 $42.99 is considerably cheaper than the alternatives. YouTube TV costs $72.99 per month; Sling TV is $55 per month; DirecTV Stream is $80 per month; Hulu Live TV is $77 per month; and Fubo TV's cheapest plan is $79.99 per month. But again, Venu's price is only good for the first year.

##  When Is Venu Sports Coming Out?

 Venu Sports is slated to launch in "Fall 2024"—there has been no official release date given. It's safe to say Disney, FOX, and WB would love to cash in on the upcoming football season, but there are some legal matters to attend to first.

[In February](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-master-plan-youtube-content-into-mp4/), Fubo TV sued the companies responsible for Venu for antitrust violations and a plot to manipulate the market. Their argument is that Venu will be the only option for people who want sports channels without entertainment channels, and the companies behind Venu are actively preventing other providers (Fubo) from offering the same type of package.

 Earlier in August, Fubo TV began pleading its case to a U.S. District Judge, seeking a preliminary injunction. If granted and passed by the Court of Appeals, Venu would be forced to halt its launch plans by months and possibly years.
