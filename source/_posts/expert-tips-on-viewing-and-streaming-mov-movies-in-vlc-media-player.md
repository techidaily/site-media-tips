### What If VLC MOV Media Player not Working Happens?

Though VLC media player has most necessary codecs preinstalled including the MOV-relevant files, there are still various reasons causing VLC not playing MOV problem.

However, when VLC can't MOV videos because of video audio codec, the problem is not that easy to tackle.

Just like MP4 format, MOV is also a container format that uses a handful of video and audio codecs. A MOV file encoded with H.264/AAC is compatible with most of the [media players](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) including VLC media player in the market.
